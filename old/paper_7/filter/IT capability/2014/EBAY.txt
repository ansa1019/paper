overview we are a global technology company that enables commerce through three reportable segments: marketplaces, payments and enterprise. our marketplaces segment includes our ebay.com platform and its localized counterparts and our other online platforms, such as our online classifieds sites and stubhub. our payments segment is comprised of our paypal business. our enterprise segment includes our magento business and provides commerce technologies, omnichannel operations and marketing solutions for merchants of all sizes that operate in general merchandise categories. on january 21, 2015, we announced that we will be exploring strategic options, including a possible sale or ipo, of ebay enterprise.
on september 30, 2014, we announced that our board of directors, following a strategic review of our growth strategies and structure, had approved a plan to separate paypal (consisting primarily of our payments segment) into an independent publicly traded company. we expect to complete the transaction as a tax-free spin-off in the second half of 2015, subject to market, regulatory, and certain other conditions. we also announced that dan schulman has been appointed as president of paypal and ceo-designee of the standalone paypal company following separation, and that devin wenig, currently president of ebay marketplaces, will become ceo of ebay following separation. the separation is subject to risks, uncertainties and conditions and there can be no assurance that the separation will be completed on the terms or on the timing currently contemplated, or at all. please see the information in "item 1a: risk factors" under the heading "risk factors related to the planned separation," which describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed separation.
we expect to incur significant costs in connection with our planned separation of our paypal business. these costs relate primarily to third-party advisory and consulting services, retention payments to certain employees, incremental stock-based compensation and other costs directly related to the separation. costs related to employees for retention or stock-based compensation are classified on a basis consistent with their regular compensation charges and included within cost of net revenues, sales and marketing, product development or general and administrative in our consolidated statement of income as applicable. costs other than those paid to employees are included within general and administrative in our consolidated statement of income. during 2014, we incurred approximately $35 million related to separation costs. we expect to continue to incur additional separation costs in 2015 until we complete the separation of our paypal business. we currently estimate that such additional separation costs will exceed $250 million, although that estimate is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.
in 2014, net revenues increased 12% to $17.9 billion compared to $16.0 billion in 2013, driven primarily by increases in net revenues from each of our business segments. we achieved an operating margin of 20% in 2014 compared to 21% in 2013. our diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.04 in 2014, a $2.14 decrease per share compared to 2013, driven primarily by the accrual of deferred taxes on $9.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings for 2013 and prior years, partially offset by growth in net revenues and a lower share count. we generated cash flow from operations of approximately $5.7 billion in 2014 compared to $5.0 billion in 2013.
our marketplaces segment total net revenues increased $533 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in total net revenues was driven primarily by an increase in gross merchandise volume (gmv) (as defined below) of 9%, which was due to continued growth internationally and in the u.s. and a favorable impact from foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar. we believe that during 2014, gmv was negatively impacted by declines in volume caused by lower organic traffic and our second quarter cyberattack described below. our marketplaces segment operating margin decreased 2.7 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013 due primarily to continued investments in our marketing programs, site operations and business initiatives.
as previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2014, our marketplaces segment experienced a cyberattack that compromised an authentication database containing user names, encrypted passwords and other non-financial data of our customers. the attack resulted from a small number of employee log-in credentials that were compromised. the database included ebay marketplaces customers' name, encrypted password, e-mail address, physical address, phone number and date of birth. the database did not contain any financial information or other confidential personal information. as a result of this attack we generally required marketplaces users to reset their passwords in order to access their accounts on our core marketplaces platform and its localized counterparts. this attack was isolated to our ebay platform and we have seen no evidence of unauthorized access or compromises to personal or financial information of our paypal users, as that data is stored separately on a secure network.
during 2014, we recorded cyberattack-related expenses and customer credits of approximately $46 million, of which approximately $41 million have been reported within our marketplaces segment. expenses include costs to investigate and remediate the attack, provide additional customer support and temporarily enhance customer protection as well as additional marketing program costs. customer credits were voluntarily offered as refunds to sellers during the password reset period and were recorded as a reduction of revenue. many of these measures were undertaken to preserve our customers' trust in our marketplaces businesses.
the disruption arising from this cyberattack adversely affected our 2014 marketplaces segment results; however, it is not possible to precisely measure the amount of lost revenue directly attributable to the cyberattack. we are unable to predict the full impact of the cyberattack on marketplaces users' behavior in the future, including whether a change in our customers' trust could negatively impact our marketplaces segment's results of operations on an ongoing basis or require us to increase promotional efforts to regain such trust. accordingly, we are not able to precisely forecast any possible future impact to our revenues or expenses attributable to the cyberattack.
our payments segment total net revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 19%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in total net revenues was driven primarily by an increase in net total payment volume (tpv) (as defined below) of 27%. our payments segment operating margin decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to increased investment in our marketing programs and product development partially offset by a favorable transaction expense rate.
our enterprise segment total net revenues increased $72 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in total net revenues was driven primarily by an increase in gross merchandise sales (as defined below) of 13% in 2014 compared to 2013. our enterprise segment operating margin was relatively consistent for 2014 compared to 2013, increasing 0.5 percentage points.
in 2013, net revenues increased 14% to $16.0 billion compared to $14.1 billion in 2012, driven primarily by increases in net revenues from each of our business segments. we achieved an operating margin of 21% in each of 2013 and 2012. our diluted earnings per share increased to $2.18 in 2013, a $0.19 increase per share compared to 2012, driven primarily by growth in 2013 net revenues partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. we generated cash flow from operations of approximately $5.0 billion in 2013 compared to $3.8 billion in 2012.
we define gmv as the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on marketplaces platforms (excluding ebay's classifieds websites, brands4friends and shopping.com) during the applicable period regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction; excludes vehicles and real estate gross merchandise volume. we believe that gmv provides a useful measure of the overall volume of closed transactions that flow through our marketplaces trading platforms in a given period, notwithstanding the inclusion in gmv of closed transactions that are not ultimately consummated. we define net tpv as the total dollar volume of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our payments networks, including paypal credit, venmo and payments processed through braintree's full stack payments platform during the period; it excludes payments sent or received through paypal's and braintree's payment gateway businesses. we define merchant services net tpv as the total dollar volume of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our payments networks, including paypal credit, venmo and payments processed through
braintree's full stack payments platform during the period; it excludes paypal's and braintree's payment gateway businesses and payments for transactions on our marketplaces platforms. we define on ebay net tpv as the total dollar volume of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our payments networks, including paypal credit, during the period for transactions on our marketplaces platforms. we define gross merchandise sales as the retail value of all sales transactions, inclusive of freight charges and net of allowance for returns and discounts, which flow through our enterprise commerce technologies, whether we record the full amount of such transaction as a product sale or a percentage of such transaction as a service fee; excludes volume transacted through the magento platform. we define ecv as the total marketplaces gmv, payments merchant services net tpv and ebay enterprise gross merchandise sales not earned on ebay or paid for via paypal or paypal credit during the period; it excludes volume transacted through the magento platform.
results of operations summary of net revenues we generate two types of net revenues: net transaction revenues and marketing services and other revenues. our net transaction revenues are derived principally from listing fees and final value fees (which are fees payable on transactions closed on our marketplaces platforms), fees paid by merchants for payment processing services and ecommerce service fees. our marketing services revenues are derived principally from the sale of advertisements, revenue sharing arrangements, classifieds fees, marketing service fees and lead referral fees. other revenues are derived principally from interest and fees earned on the paypal credit portfolio of receivables from loans, interest earned on certain paypal customer account balances and fees from contractual arrangements with third parties that provide services to our users.
the following table sets forth the breakdown of net revenues by type and geography for the periods presented.(1)
(in millions, except percentage changes)
net transaction revenues marketplaces                                      $6,995                  $6,569                  $5,834

(1)   during the first quarter of 2014, we changed our reportable segments based upon changes in our organizational structure which reflect the integration of our magento platform into our enterprise segment. prior to this change, magento was reported in corporate and other. also during the first quarter of 2014, we revised our internal management reporting of certain marketplaces transactions to align more closely with our related operating metrics. related to this change, we reclassified our marketplaces vehicles and real estate revenues from net transaction revenues to marketing services and other revenues. prior period amounts have been revised to conform to the current period segment reporting structure.
revenues are attributed to u.s. and international geographies based primarily upon the country in which the seller, payment recipient, customer, website that displays advertising, or other service provider, as the case may be, is located.
because we generated a majority of our net revenues internationally in recent periods, including the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we are subject to the risks of doing business in foreign countries as discussed under "item 1a: risk factors" under the heading "we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates." in that regard, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations. we have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies; however, the effectiveness of this program in mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations varies from period to period, and in any given period, our operating results are usually affected, sometimes significantly, by changes in currency exchange rates. fluctuations in exchange rates also directly affect our cross-border revenue. we calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amounts.
for the year ended december 31, 2014, foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately $30 million (inclusive of a $36 million negative impact from hedging activities relating to paypal's net revenue). foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2014 positively impacted marketplaces net revenues by approximately $56 million and negatively impacted payments and enterprise net revenues by approximately $25 million and $1 million, respectively (inclusive of the impact of hedging activities, noted above, in the case of payments net revenues).
for the year ended december 31, 2013, foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately $24 million (inclusive of a $4 million negative impact from hedging activities relating to paypal's net revenue). foreign currency movements relative to the u.s. dollar for the year ended december 31, 2013 positively impacted marketplaces net revenues by approximately $36 million and negatively impacted payments and enterprise net revenues by approximately $11 million and less than $1 million, respectively (inclusive of the impact of hedging activities, noted above, in the case of payments net revenues).
the following table sets forth, for the periods presented, certain key operating metrics that we believe are significant factors affecting our net revenues.

seasonality the following table sets forth, for the periods presented, our total net revenues and the sequential quarterly movements of these net revenues:
(in millions, except percentage changes)
percent change from prior quarter          (3   )%                4    %                  0      %               17     %
percent change from prior quarter          (6   )%                3    %                  0      %               16     %
percent change from prior quarter          (6   )%                2    %                  0      %               13     %
we expect transaction activity patterns on our websites to mirror general consumer buying patterns. our enterprise segment is highly seasonal. the fourth calendar quarter typically accounts for a disproportionate amount of enterprise's total annual revenues because consumers increase their purchases and businesses increase their advertising to consumers during the fourth quarter holiday season. we expect these trends to continue.
marketplaces net transaction revenues marketplaces net transaction revenues increased $426 million, or 6%, in 2014 compared to 2013, while gmv increased 9% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in net transaction revenues was due primarily to continued growth in volume, as well as a benefit from foreign currency movements against the u.s. dollar. our net transaction revenue growth was negatively impacted by declines in volume caused by a reduction in traffic from lower organic traffic, such as google's search engine algorithm changes and our second quarter cyberattack described above. the growth in net transaction revenues was lower than the growth in gmv due primarily a lower marketplaces transaction take rate as we invested in our buyer loyalty programs and seller incentives, which are accounted for as a reduction of revenue, and to a lesser extent, due to pricing changes at our stubhub business.
marketplaces net transaction revenues increased $735 million, or 13%, in 2013 compared to 2012, consistent with the increase in gmv of 13% in 2013 compared to 2012. the increase in net transaction revenues and gmv was due to continued growth in active users, growth in mobile volume and the continued improvements in the customer experience. in addition, seller discounts and buyer loyalty programs had a negative impact on revenue growth.
marketplaces net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled $4.0 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, representing 57%, 56% and 56% of total marketplaces net transaction revenues in the respective periods.
payments net transaction revenues payments net transaction revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 18%, during 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to an increase in net tpv of 27%. the growth in payments net transaction revenues was lower than the growth in net tpv due to a lower take rate. the increase in net tpv was due primarily to growth in consumer and merchant use of paypal both on and off ebay and growth in volume through our braintree products. the lower take rate was due primarily to a higher portion of merchant services volume. merchant services volume includes a higher concentration of net tpv from larger merchants who generate higher volume at lower rates. additionally, merchant services volume includes net tpv generated through our unbranded products such as braintree where we generally earn lower take rates. we expect the concentration of merchant services volume to continue to increase. our merchant services net tpv increased 34% during 2014 compared to 2013 and represented 74% of paypal's net tpv in 2014, compared with 70% in 2013. on ebay net tpv increased 10% during 2014 compared to 2013, and represented 26% of paypal's net tpv in 2014.
payments net transaction revenues increased $950 million, or 18%, during 2013 compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in net tpv of 24%. the growth in payments net transaction revenues was lower than the growth in net tpv due to a lower take rate. the increase in net tpv was due primarily to growth in consumer and merchant adoption and use of paypal both on and off ebay. the lower take rate was due primarily to a shift to larger merchants who pay lower rates. our merchant services net tpv increased 29% during 2013 compared to 2012 and represented 70% of paypal's net tpv in 2013, compared with 67% in 2012. on ebay net tpv increased 14% during 2013 compared to 2012, and represented 30% of paypal's net tpv in 2013.
payments net transaction revenues earned internationally totaled $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion and $2.8 billion in 2014, 2013 and 2012, representing 56%, 56% and 55% of total payments net transaction revenues, respectively.
enterprise net transaction revenues enterprise net transaction revenues increased $87 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to 2013, due primarily to an increase in gross merchandise sales of 13%. the growth in enterprise net transaction revenues was lower than the growth in gross merchandise sales due to a lower transaction take rate. the lower transaction take rate was due to increases in gross merchandise sales for certain merchants that triggered lower contractual take rates.
enterprise net transaction revenues increased $48 million, or 6%, in 2013 compared to 2012, due primarily to an increase in gross merchandise sales of 14%, partially offset by a lower transaction take rate.
marketing services and other revenues marketing services and other revenues increased $246 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to 2013, and represented 15% in 2014 and 16% in 2013 of total net revenues. the increase in marketing services and other revenues was due primarily to growth in our paypal credit portfolio of receivables from loans, as well as increased revenue from advertising.
marketing services and other revenues increased $252 million, or 11%, in 2013 compared to 2012, and represented 16% of total net revenues for both periods. the increase in marketing services and other revenues was due primarily to growth in our paypal credit portfolio of loan receivables, as well as increased revenue from advertising.

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising costs and marketing programs (both online and offline), employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. online marketing expenses represent traffic acquisition costs in various channels such as paid search, affiliates marketing and display advertising. offline advertising includes brand campaigns, buyer/seller communications and general public relations expenses.
sales and marketing expense increased by $527 million, or 17%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to an increase in marketing program costs (both online and offline programs), ebay's and paypal's brand campaigns and higher employee-related expenses (including consultant costs). sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues were 20% and 19% in 2014 and 2013, respectively.
sales and marketing expense increased by $147 million, or 5%, in 2013 compared to 2012. the increase in sales and marketing expense was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses (including consultant costs, facility costs and equipment-related costs), partially offset by a decrease in professional services fees and marketing program efficiencies. the decrease in marketing program costs was due primarily to a shift in focus from customer acquisition to customer retention (for which certain associated expenses are recorded as a reduction in revenue instead of sales and marketing expense). sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenues were 19% and 21% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
product development product development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs and depreciation on equipment. product development expenses are net of required capitalization of major site and other product development efforts, including the development of our next generation platform architecture, migration of certain platforms, seller tools and payments services projects. our top technology priorities include mobile, user experience, search, platform and products.
capitalized internal use and website development costs were $395 million and $375 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are primarily reflected as a cost of net revenues when amortized in future periods.
product development expenses increased by $232 million, or 13%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs (including consultant costs) driven by increased investment in platform and mobile. product development expenses as a net percentage of revenues were 11% in both 2014 and 2013.
product development expenses increased by $195 million, or 12%, in 2013 compared to 2012. the increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs (including consultant costs, facility costs and equipment-related costs) driven by increased investment in platform, search, mobile and offline, as well as an increase in professional service fees. product development expenses as a net percentage of revenues were 11% in both 2013 and 2012.
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee compensation, contractor costs, facilities costs, depreciation of equipment, employer payroll taxes on employee stock-based compensation, legal expenses, restructuring, insurance premiums and professional fees. our legal expenses, including those related to various ongoing legal proceedings, may fluctuate substantially from period to period.
general and administrative expenses increased $140 million, or 8%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs and costs related to our planned separation of our paypal business. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 10% in 2014 and 11% in 2013.
general and administrative expenses increased $136 million, or 9%, in 2013 compared to 2012. the increase was due primarily to higher employee-related costs (including consultant costs, facility costs and equipment-related costs) and an increase in professional service fees partially offset by a decrease in restructuring costs. general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues were 11% in both 2013 and 2012.
provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks; credit losses associated with our consumer and merchant loan receivables; and bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balance. we expect our provision for transaction and loan loss expense to fluctuate depending on many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.
provision for transaction and loan losses increased by $167 million, or 21%, in 2014 compared to 2013. this increase was attributable to both our marketplaces and payments segments. provision for transaction and loan loss expense as a percentage of net revenues was 5% in both 2014 and 2013.
marketplaces provision for transaction losses increased by $24 million, or 10%, in 2014 compared to 2013. this increase was driven primarily by an increase in transaction volume, partially offset by improvements in our fraud detection models.
payments provision for transaction and loan losses increased by $138 million, or 25%, in 2014 compared to 2013. this increase was due primarily to higher transaction volume, the introduction of new products and initiatives to enhance customers' experience. the increase was also due to growth in our paypal credit portfolio of receivables from consumer loans.
provision for transaction and loan losses increased by $211 million, or 36%, in 2013 compared to 2012. this increase was attributable to both our marketplaces and payments segments. provision for transaction and loan loss expense as a percentage of net revenues was 5% and 4% in 2013 and 2012, respectively.
marketplaces provision for transaction losses increased by $62 million, or 36%, in 2013 compared to 2012. this increase was due primarily to higher transaction volume. the volume increase in the transaction losses was due primarily to an increase in the number of cases being opened under our ebay money back guarantee as a result of our simplified process for users to file claims which resulted in higher transaction losses.
payments provision for transaction and loan losses increased by $149 million, or 38%, in 2013 compared to 2012. this increase was due primarily to higher paypal transaction losses driven by higher transaction volume, due to the introduction of new products, initiatives to enhance customers' experience, and growth in active registered accounts. the increase was also due to growth in our paypal credit portfolio of loan receivables from consumer loans. modifications to our paypal credit acceptable risk parameters did not have a material impact on our provision for loan losses for the periods presented.
amortization of acquired intangible assets from time to time we have purchased, and we expect to continue to purchase, assets and businesses. these purchase transactions generally result in the creation of acquired intangible assets with finite lives and lead to a corresponding increase in our amortization expense in periods subsequent to acquisition. we amortize intangible assets over the period of estimated benefit, using the straight-line method and estimated useful lives ranging from one to eight years. amortization of acquired intangible assets is also impacted by our sales of assets and businesses and timing of acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized. see "note 4 - goodwill and intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by $50 million, or 16%, in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease was due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized during the year.
amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased by $17 million, or 5%, in 2013 compared to 2012.
interest and other, net interest and other, net, primarily consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our portion of operating results from investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, investment gain/loss on acquisitions, and interest expense, consisting of interest charges on any amounts borrowed and commitment fees on unborrowed amounts under our credit agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt securities and commercial paper, if any. interest and other, net excludes interest expense on borrowings incurred to finance paypal credit's portfolio of loan receivables, which is included in cost of net revenues.
interest and other, net, decreased $78 million in 2014 compared to 2013. the decrease in interest and other, net was due primarily to a gain on the sale of our investments in ruelala and shoprunner in september 2013.
interest and other, net, decreased $101 million in 2013 compared to 2012. the decrease in interest and other, net was due primarily to a gain on a divested business of $118 million in 2012 and an increase in interest expense as a result of our issuance of $3 billion of senior notes in july 2012. the decrease was partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investments in ruelala and shoprunner in september 2013.
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was 99% in 2014 compared to 18% in 2013. the increase in our effective tax rate during 2014 compared to 2013 was due primarily to the recognition during the year of deferred tax liabilities of approximately $3.0 billion of u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on $9.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years, partially offset by the release of the valuation allowance on our capital loss carryover.
our effective tax rate was 18% in 2013 compared to 15% in 2012. the increase in our effective tax rate during 2013 compared to 2012 was due primarily to increases in foreign earnings subject to u.s. tax and the tax impact of repayment of the kynetic note receivable and the sale of our investments in ruelala and shoprunner in 2013.
as of december 31, 2013, we had approximately $14.0 billion of indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings for which we had not provided u.s. income or applicable foreign withholding taxes. during the first quarter of 2014, we altered our capital allocation strategy, which included changing our intent with regard to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years. accordingly, during the first quarter of 2014, we determined that a portion of these foreign earnings were no longer considered indefinitely reinvested in our international operations. in connection with this change in our capital allocation strategy during the first quarter of 2014, we provided for u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on $9.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years, and recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.0 billion. based on december 31, 2014 foreign exchange rates, these amounts have been revalued at $8.2 billion of undistributed foreign earnings and $2.8 billion of deferred tax liability. the remaining approximately $5.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings for 2013 and prior years remains indefinitely reinvested in our international operations.
this change during the first quarter of 2014 reflected our objectives of increasing our available u.s. cash, preserving our credit rating and providing greater liquidity to meet our cash needs in the u.s., including, among other things and subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, merger and acquisition activity and potentially funding opportunistic share repurchases on an accelerated basis, potentially in the near term.
in addition to the accrual of deferred taxes related to undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our non-u.s. subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years discussed above, during 2014, we recorded $207 million of u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on $613 million of undistributed foreign earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries. the amount of u.s. income and applicable foreign taxes recorded for 2014 was based on our 2014 earnings of our non-u.s. subsidiaries that are not considered indefinitely reinvested in our foreign operations. the amount represents u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on 2014 foreign earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested, reflecting a larger percentage of foreign earnings subject to u.s. tax compared to 2013.
our relative pretax earnings and revenues attributable to the u.s. as compared to the rest of the world may differ over time. for the year ended december 31, 2014, our u.s. share of pretax income and net revenues was 4.9% and 47.5%, respectively. for the year ended december 31, 2013, our u.s. share of pretax income and net revenues was 17.1% and 48.1%, respectively. the difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the u.s., as compared to the rest of the world for both 2014 and 2013, was primarily related to our enterprise segment, which has lower u.s. based operating margins and higher amortization of u.s. based intangible assets, larger stock-based compensation expense recorded in the u.s. for u.s. based employees, overhead related to our corporate operations which are primarily u.s. based and higher average margins earned by non-u.s. businesses.
our provision for income taxes differs from the provision computed by applying the u.s. federal statutory rate of 35% due primarily to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in certain lower-tax jurisdictions outside the u.s. the impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates than the u.s. federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately $709 million in 2014, $607 million in 2013 and $617 million in 2012. we benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions, most significantly switzerland, singapore and luxembourg. these rulings provide for significantly lower rates of taxation on certain classes of income and require various thresholds of investment and employment in those jurisdictions. we evaluate compliance with our tax ruling agreements annually. the cash benefit of these reduced rates totaled approximately $555 million in 2014, $540 million in 2013 and $439 million in 2012. the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes in the periods presented include switzerland, singapore and luxembourg. see "note 16 - income taxes" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliation.
our provision for income taxes is volatile and, in general, is adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates. our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with $7.9 billion of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest those earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries. if these earnings were distributed into the u.s. in the form of dividends to ebay companies domiciled in the u.s. or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, we would be subject to additional u.s. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. further, as a result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment actions and commitments, our income in certain countries including switzerland, singapore and luxembourg, is subject to reduced tax rates. our failure to meet these commitments could adversely impact our provision for income taxes. additionally, please see the information in "item 1a: risk factors" under the caption "we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities."
from time to time, we engage in certain intercompany transactions and legal entity restructurings. we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions, including the alignment of our corporate structure with our organizational objectives and the operational and tax efficiency of our corporate structure, as well as the long-term cash flows and cash needs of our different businesses. these transactions may impact our overall tax rate and/or result in additional cash tax payments. the impact in any period may be significant. these transactions may be complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimate.
we are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally. we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations. due to the ongoing tax examinations, we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustments.

investing activities the net cash used in investing activities of $2.7 billion in 2014 was due primarily to net cash paid for purchases of investments of $8.8 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $1.3 billion and the purchase of consumer loan receivables (net of collections and charge-offs) originated through our paypal credit products of $1.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds of $8.5 billion for sales of investments.
the net cash used in investing activities of $6.0 billion in 2013 was due primarily to net cash paid for purchases of investments of $7.5 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $1.3 billion and the purchase of consumer loan receivables (net of collections and charge-offs) originated through our paypal credit products of $794 million, partially offset by proceeds of $3.9 billion for sales of investments.
the net cash used in investing activities of $3.8 billion in 2012 was due primarily to net cash paid for purchases of investments of $3.1 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $1.3 billion and the purchase of consumer loan receivables (net of collections) originated through our paypal credit products of $727 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.4 billion for sales of investments.
financing activities the net cash used in financing activities of $1.0 billion in 2014 was due primarily to cash outflows of $4.7 billion to repurchase common stock and $252 million paid for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units. these cash outflows were partially offset by inflows of $3.5 billion from the issuance of senior notes, $300 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and $115 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
the net cash used in financing activities of $1.4 billion in 2013 was due primarily to cash outflows of $1.3 billion to repurchase our common stock, $400 million for the net repayment of debt and $267 million paid for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units. these cash outflows were partially offset by inflows of $437 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and $201 million in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
the net cash provided by financing activities of $2.0 billion in 2012 was due primarily to cash inflows of approximately $3.0 billion from the issuance of senior notes, $483 million from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan, and $130 million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation. these cash inflows were partially offset by outflows of $898 million in cash paid to repurchase our common stock, $550 million for the net repayment of commercial paper, and $186 million in cash paid for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units. we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes to repay outstanding commercial paper.
the negative effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2014 was due to the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro and korean won. the positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2013 was due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the euro. the positive effect of currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents during 2012 was due to the weakening of the u.s. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the british pound and the euro.
stock repurchases in june 2012, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provided for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock, with no expiration from the date of authorization. in january 2014, our board of directors authorized an additional $5 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. these stock repurchase programs are intended to offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and, subject to market conditions and other factors, are also used to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce outstanding share count. any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions, block trades, privately negotiated transactions (including accelerated share repurchase transactions) or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternatives.
during 2014, we repurchased approximately $4.7 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs. as of december 31, 2014, we had repurchased the full amount of common stock authorized under our june 2012 stock repurchase program and a total of approximately $985 million remained available for further repurchases of our common stock under our january 2014 stock repurchase program.
in addition, in january 2015, our board of directors authorized an additional $2 billion stock repurchase program, with no expiration from the date of authorization. this new stock repurchase program, together with approximately $985 million remaining under our january 2014 stock repurchase program, brings the total repurchase authorization as of january 2015 to approximately $3.0 billion.
we expect, subject to market conditions and other uncertainties, to continue making opportunistic repurchases of our stock. however, our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice. the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including corporate and regulatory requirements, price and other market conditions and management's determination as to the appropriate use of our cash.
shelf registration statement at december 31, 2014, we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities, as well as common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares representing fractional interest in shares of preferred stock, purchase contracts and units from time to time in one or more offerings. each issuance under the shelf registration statement will require the filing of a prospectus supplement identifying the amount and terms of the securities to be issued. the registration statement does not limit the amount of securities that may be issued thereunder. our ability to issue securities is subject to market conditions and other factors including, in the case of our debt securities, our credit ratings and compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement.
in july 2014, we issued $3.5 billion of senior unsecured notes, or senior notes, in an underwritten public offering. these senior notes remain outstanding and consist of $450 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2017, $400 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due 2019, $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.2% notes due 2019, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% notes due 2021 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.45% notes due 2024. these funds were used for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings during 2014.
to help achieve our interest rate risk management objectives, in connection with the july 2014 issuance of senior unsecured notes, we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted $2.4 billion of those fixed rate notes to floating rate debt based on the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a spread. these swaps were designated as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of certain fixed rate senior notes resulting from changes in interest rates.
we previously issued senior notes in underwritten public offerings, of which $250 million aggregate principal amount of 0.70% notes due 2015, $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.35% notes due 2017, $1 billion aggregate principal amount
the indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued includes customary covenants that, among other things and subject to exceptions, limit our ability to incur, assume or guarantee debt secured by liens on specified assets or enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to specified properties, and also includes customary events of default.
commercial paper we have a $2 billion commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue commercial paper notes with maturities of up to 397 days from the date of issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to $2 billion at any time outstanding. as of december 31, 2014, there were no commercial paper notes outstanding. we have in the past used proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper notes for general corporate purposes, including funding share repurchases. we may elect, subject to market conditions, to issue additional commercial paper notes from time to time in the future.
credit agreement in 2011, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured $3 billion five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $300 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $100 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. we may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the revolving credit facility by up to $1 billion. funds borrowed under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes.
as of december 31, 2014, no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under our $3 billion credit agreement. as described above, we have an up to $2 billion commercial paper program and we maintain $2 billion of available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they become due. as a result, at december 31, 2014, $1 billion of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by the credit agreement.
loans under the credit agreement bear interest at either (i) the london interbank offered rate (libor) plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from 0.625 percent to 1.125 percent or (ii) a formula based on the agent bank's prime rate, the federal funds effective rate or libor plus a margin (based on our public debt credit ratings) ranging from zero percent to 0.125 percent. the credit agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on november 22, 2016, unless (a) the commitments are terminated earlier, either at our request or, if an event of default occurs, by the lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events of default), or (b) the maturity date is extended upon our request, subject to the agreement of the lenders. the credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the banks. the negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, subject to certain exceptions. the financial covenant requires us to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio.
we were in compliance with all covenants in our outstanding debt instruments for the period ended december 31, 2014.
other indebtedness in addition to the debt described above, as of december 31, 2014, we had $19 million of borrowings outstanding under our overdraft facilities.
credit ratings as of january 1, 2014, our long-term debt and short-term funding were rated investment grade by standard and poor's financial services, llc (long-term rated a, short-term rated a-1, with a stable outlook), moody's investor service (long-term rated a2, short-term rated p-1, with a stable outlook), and fitch ratings, inc. (long-term rated a, short-term rated f1, with a stable outlook). following the september 2014 announcement of our planned separation of our paypal business, standard and poor's financial services, llc and moody's investor service placed our long-term debt and short-term funding ratings under review with negative implications, while fitch ratings, inc. downgraded our long-term debt from a to a- and short-term funding from f1 to f2, retaining our investment grade status, and has also placed those ratings under review with negative implications. we did not experience any material operational, funding, or liquidity impacts from this rating downgrade. we
expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor developments in our planned separation of paypal, including the capital structure for each company after separation, which could result in additional downgrades.
our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and because downgrades would likely increase our borrowing costs we disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds. in addition, to assist paypal in our planned separation we are currently working with credit rating agencies to obtain separate credit ratings for paypal and we believe that immediately following separation both ebay and paypal will be rated investment grade.
commitments and contingencies as of december 31, 2014, approximately $20.2 billion of unused credit was available to paypal credit accountholders. while this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all of our paypal credit accountholders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. in addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination by the chartered financial institutions that are the issuer of paypal credit products based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. when a consumer makes a purchase using a paypal credit products, the chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer, funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant. we subsequently purchase the consumer receivables related to the consumer loans and as result of that purchase, bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults. however, we subsequently sell a participation interest in the entire pool of consumer loans to the chartered financial institution that extended the consumer loans. although the chartered financial institution continues to own the customer accounts, we own and bear the risk of loss on the related consumer receivables, less the participation interest held by the chartered financial institution, and paypal is responsible for all servicing functions related to the customer account balances. as of december 31, 2014, the total outstanding principal balance of this pool of consumer loans was $3.7 billion, of which the chartered financial institution owns a participation interest of $163 million, or 4.4% of the total outstanding balance of consumer receivables at that date.
we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. the following table summarizes our fixed contractual obligations and commitments:
•   debt amounts include the principal and interest amounts of the respective debt instruments. for additional details related to our debt, please see "note 10 - debt" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. this table does not reflect any amounts payable under our $3 billion revolving credit facility or $2 billion commercial paper program, for which no borrowings were outstanding as of december 31, 2014.
•   lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases for office facilities, fulfillment centers, as well as computer and office equipment that we utilize under lease arrangements. the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.
•   purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, construction contracts) and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.
as we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table does not include $410 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31, 2014.
liquidity and capital resource requirements at december 31, 2014, we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents, as well as short and long-term non-equity investments, in an aggregate amount of $14.6 billion, compared to $12.8 billion at december 31, 2013. at december 31, 2014, this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately $10.1 billion. if these assets were distributed to the u.s., we may be subject to additional u.s. taxes in certain circumstances. as described under "--provision for income taxes" above, during 2014, we accrued deferred taxes of approximately $3.0 billion on $9.0 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest in our international operations, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. based on the december 31, 2014 foreign exchange rate, these amounts have been revalued at $8.2 billion of undistributed foreign earnings and $2.8 billion of accrued deferred taxes. as of december 31, 2014, we had not repatriated any of these undistributed foreign earnings to the u.s. and, as a result, we have not yet paid u.s. tax on any portion of those earnings. however, to the extent that we repatriate these earnings to the u.s., we will be required to pay u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs. to the extent we repatriate this $8.2 billion of undistributed foreign earnings, we estimate, based on current tax rates, that it would increase our u.s. cash by approximately $5.4 billion, net of related tax.
we actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and non-equity investments, focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets. we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties. to date, we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments; however, we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash, cash equivalents or short-term investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets. at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutions.
we currently fund the expansion of the paypal credit portfolio of loan receivables with domestic and international cash resources and borrowings. to the extent that our paypal credit or other credit products become more widely available through improved and more comprehensive product integrations with ebay, paypal and other channels, and as we further promote paypal credit or other credit products, customer adoption and usage of such products may expand. any resulting growth in the portfolio of paypal credit or other loan receivables would increase our liquidity needs and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect the paypal credit products.
in june 2014, we agreed, subject to certain conditions, that paypal, one of its affiliates or a third party partner will purchase a portfolio of consumer loan receivables relating to the customer accounts arising out of our current credit program agreement with synchrony (formerly ge capital retail bank) for a price based on the book value of the consumer loan receivables portfolio at the time of the purchase (expected to be october 2016), subject to certain adjustments and exclusions. as of december 31, 2014, synchrony had a net receivables portfolio under the credit program agreement of approximately $1.5 billion.
we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments, together with cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program, and our access to capital markets, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, paypal credit portfolio of loan receivables and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future.
off-balance sheet arrangements as of december 31, 2014, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
we have various cash pooling arrangements with financial institutions for cash management purposes. these arrangements allow for cash withdrawals from these financial institutions based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution ("aggregate cash deposits"). these arrangements also allow us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by these financial institutions as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under these arrangements. as of december 31, 2014, we had a total of $7.2 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $7.2 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within these financial institutions under these cash pooling arrangements.
indemnification provisions in the ordinary course of business, we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations, including our standard marketing, promotions and application-programming-interface license agreements. under these contracts, we generally indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names, trademarks, logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement. in many of its major ecommerce agreements, our enterprise business has agreed to indemnify enterprise clients against certain claims by third parties regarding our products and services; these agreements may include indemnities related to various intellectual property rights, and we have provided similar indemnities in a limited number of agreements for our other businesses. in certain cases we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement. in our paypal business, we have provided an indemnity to our payment processors in the event of certain third-party claims or card association fines against the processor arising out of conduct by paypal or paypal customers. paypal has also provided a limited indemnity to merchants using its retail point of sale payment services and to manufacturers of its point of sale devices (e.g., the paypal here devices and the beacon device). in addition, bill me later has provided indemnification provisions in its agreements with the chartered financial institutions that issue its credit products. it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision. to date, losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant, either individually or collectively.
paypal separation as disclosed above, in september 2014 we announced our plan to separate paypal into an independent publicly traded company. we expect to complete the separation in the second half of 2015. in connection with this action we are undertaking capital structure planning for each company. we are working to ensure that each separate business is well capitalized with financial flexibility to pursue their strategic priorities. we have not accrued u.s. income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on the unremitted foreign earnings that we currently plan to indefinitely reinvest. these plans may change as a result of our capital structure planning. changes made to our capital structure in preparation for the separation may impact the amount indefinitely reinvested or the tax consequences of repatriating foreign earnings. such a change in either would impact the amount of tax accrued on unremitted foreign earnings, which could change the amount of cash available for each separate entity.
critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. our senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. the following descriptions of critical
accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report.
provision for transaction and loan losses provision for transaction and loan losses consists primarily of transaction loss expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks and merchant credit losses, bad debt expense associated with our accounts receivable balances and loan losses associated with our loan receivables balances. we expect our provision for transaction and loan loss expense to fluctuate depending on many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, our customer protection programs and the impact of regulatory changes.
the following table illustrates the provision for transaction and loan losses as a percentage of net revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012:
provision for transaction and loan losses                               $958                    $791                    $580
provision for transaction and loan losses as a % of net revenues         5.4     %   4.9                 %               4.1     %
determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and is subject to numerous estimates and judgments, and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. we regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. the allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. an aggregate 50 basis point deviation from our provision for transaction and loan losses as a percentage of net revenues would have resulted in an increase or decrease in operating income of approximately $90 million in 2014, resulting in an approximate $0.05 change in diluted earnings per share.
legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims, we have estimated the range of probable loss, net of expected recoveries, and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income. these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events.
from time to time, we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business. we are currently involved in legal proceedings, some of which are discussed in "item 1a: risk factors," "item 3: legal proceedings" and "note 11 - commitments and contingencies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us, and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously. however, even if successful, our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of management's time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources. if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims, we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees, modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business. any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of any or all of our business segments.
accounting for income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. in addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s. indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations. at december 31, 2014, $7.9 billion of earnings had been indefinitely reinvested outside the u.s., primarily in active non-u.s. business operations. we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund u.s. operations and, accordingly, we do not provide for u.s. federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings.
deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. at december 31, 2014, we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the u.s., or gaap, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. we recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome. we adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.
the following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 2014, 2013 and 2012:
provision for income taxes                $3,485                    $610                    $475
as a % of income before income taxes          99     %   18                  %                15     %
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes or interpretations in tax laws, regulations or accounting principles. in addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service, as well as various state and foreign tax authorities. we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.
based on our results for the year ended december 31, 2014, a one-percentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately $35 million, resulting in an approximate $0.03 change in diluted earnings per share.
revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue transactions, primarily related to arrangements in our enterprise segment and certain advertising contracts, that are considered multiple element arrangements (arrangements with more than one deliverable). we also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods and/or services from certain customers. as a result, significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including: (1) how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables; (2) developing an estimate of the stand-alone selling price of each deliverable; (3) whether revenue should be reported gross (as ebay is acting as a principal), or net (as ebay is acting as an agent); (4) when we provide cash consideration to our customers, determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customer's purchase of our products and/or services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value; and (5) whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred. changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition.
goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates. these judgments can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital.
at december 31, 2014, our goodwill totaled $9.1 billion and our identifiable intangible assets, net totaled $564 million. we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment, then the reporting unit's carrying value is compared to its fair value. the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches. goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results. the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units. failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit. we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august 31, 2014 and 2013. as of december 31, 2014, we determined that no impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required. see "note 4 - goodwill and intangible assets" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
stock-based compensation we measure and recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value measurement for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including employee stock options, employee stock purchases and restricted stock awards, over the service period for awards expected to vest. stock-based compensation expense recognized for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $675 million, $609 million and $488 million, respectively. see "note 15 - stock-based and employee savings plans" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report.
we calculated the fair value of each restricted stock award based on our stock price on the date of grant. we calculated the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model. the determination of fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of additional variables described below. the use of a black-scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of assumptions, including expected life, expected volatility, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. as a result, future stock-based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts. the weighted-average grant-date fair value of stock options granted during 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $13.59, $15.39 and $11.21 per share, respectively, using the black-scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions:
expected volatility         29   %         34    %        38    %
our computation of expected volatility for 2014, 2013 and 2012 was based on a combination of historical and market-based implied volatility from traded options on our stock. our computation of expected life was determined based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award was based on the u.s. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. the estimation of awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. we consider many factors when estimating forfeitures, including employee class and historical experience.
recent accounting pronouncements see "note 1 - the company and summary of significant accounting policies" to the consolidated financial statements included in this report, regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

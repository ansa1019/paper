electrical segment the electrical segment (71%, 71% and 69% of consolidated revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively) is comprised of businesses that sell stock and custom products including standard and special application wiring device products, rough-in electrical products, connector and grounding products, lighting fixtures and controls, as well as other electrical equipment. the products are typically used in and around industrial, commercial and institutional facilities by electrical contractors, maintenance personnel, electricians and telecommunications companies. in addition, certain businesses design and manufacture a variety of high voltage test and measurement equipment, industrial controls and communication systems used in the non-residential and industrial markets. many of these products are designed such that they can also be used in harsh and hazardous locations where a potential for fire and explosion exists due to the presence of flammable gasses and vapors. harsh and hazardous products are primarily used in the oil and gas (onshore and offshore) and mining industries. there are also a variety of lighting fixtures, wiring devices and electrical products that have residential and utility applications.
these products are primarily sold through electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential product oriented internet sites. special application products are sold primarily through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers and original equipment manufacturers ("oems"). high voltage products are sold primarily by direct sales to customers through our sales engineers. hubbell maintains a sales and marketing organization to assist potential users with the application of certain products to their specific requirements, and with architects, engineers, industrial designers, oems and electrical contractors for the design of electrical systems to meet the specific requirements of industrial, non-residential and residential users. hubbell is also represented by independent manufacturers' sales agents for many of its product offerings.

as a percentage of total net sales, shipments from foreign operations directly to third parties were 14% in 2014, 16% in 2013 and 17% in 2012, with the canadian and uk operations representing approximately 31% and 26%, respectively, of 2014 total international net sales. switzerland, brazil and mexico each represent 10% of 2014 total international sales. see also note 20-industry segments and geographic area information in the notes to consolidated financial statements and item 1a. risk factors relating to manufacturing in and sourcing from foreign countries.
raw materials raw materials used in the manufacture of hubbell products primarily include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, plastics, phenolics, zinc, nickel, elastomers and petrochemicals. hubbell also purchases certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets, from a number of suppliers. hubbell is not materially dependent upon any one supplier for raw materials used in the manufacture of its products and equipment, and at the present time, raw materials and components essential to its operation are in adequate supply. however, some of these principal raw materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. see also item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
patents hubbell has approximately 1,600 active united states and foreign patents covering many of its products, which expire at various times. while hubbell deems these patents to be of value, it does not consider its business to be dependent upon patent protection. hubbell also licenses products under patents owned by others, as necessary, and grants licenses under certain of its patents.
working capital inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable levels, payment terms and, where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the electrical products industry and standard business procedures. see also item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
backlog substantially all of the backlog existing at december 31, 2014 is expected to be shipped to customers in 2015. backlog of orders believed to be firm at december 31, 2014 was approximately $333.7 million compared to $295.4 million at december 31, 2013. although this backlog is important, the majority of hubbell's revenues result from sales of inventoried products or products that have short periods of manufacture.
competition hubbell experiences substantial competition in all categories of its business, but does not compete with the same companies in all of its product categories. the number and size of competitors vary considerably depending on the product line. hubbell cannot specify with precision the number of competitors hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   5
back to contents in each product category or their relative market position. however, some of its competitors are larger companies with substantial financial and other resources. hubbell considers product performance, reliability, quality and technological innovation as important factors relevant to all areas of its business, and considers its reputation as a manufacturer of quality products to be an important factor in its business. in addition, product price, service levels and other factors can affect hubbell's ability to compete.
research and development research and development expenditures represent costs to discover and/or apply new knowledge in developing a new product or process, or in bringing about significant improvement in an existing product or process. research and development expenses are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold. expenses for research and development were approximately 2% of cost of goods sold for each of the years 2014, 2013 and 2012.
environment the company is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. the company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury to its employees and its customers' employees and that the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations.
like other companies engaged in similar businesses, the company has incurred or acquired through business combinations, remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and is a party to product liability and other lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past production of product containing toxic substances. additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. however, considering past experience and reserves, the company does not anticipate that these matters will have a material impact on earnings, capital expenditures, financial condition or competitive position. see also item 1a. risk factors and note 15 - commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
employees as of december 31, 2014, hubbell had approximately 15,400 salaried and hourly employees of which approximately 8,400 of these employees, or 54%, are located in the united states. approximately 2,400 of these u.s. employees are represented by 17 labor unions. hubbell considers its labor relations to be satisfactory.

back to contents item 7    management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview of the business the company is primarily engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of quality electrical and electronic products for a broad range of non-residential and residential construction, industrial and utility applications. products are either sourced complete, manufactured or assembled by subsidiaries in the united states, canada, switzerland, puerto rico, china, mexico, italy, the united kingdom, brazil and australia. the company also participates in joint ventures in taiwan and hong kong, and maintains offices in singapore, china, india, mexico, south korea and countries in the middle east. the company employs approximately 15,400 individuals worldwide.
the company made the following management changes in 2014 as part of its succession planning program.
in february 2014, the company promoted mr. gerben w. bakker to group vice president, power systems. mr. william t. tolley, the previous group vice president, power systems, has been named to the newly created position of senior vice president, growth and innovation.
on may 6, 2014, the board of directors appointed mr. david g. nord to the position of chairman of the board, in addition to his role as president and chief executive officer. mr. nord succeeded mr. timothy h. powers, the former chairman of the board, who retired from the board in may 2014.
on june 30, 2014, mr. gary n. amato was appointed to the position of executive vice president, hubbell electrical segment. in this role, he acquired oversight of the hubbell hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   15
back to contents lighting business, in addition to his leadership role over the electrical systems businesses. mr. amato assumed responsibility for the lighting business following the announcement of the retirement of mr. scott h. muse.
the company's reporting segments consist of the electrical segment and the power segment. results for 2014, 2013 and 2012 by segment are included under "segment results" within this management's discussion and analysis.
the company is focused on growing profits and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders by executing a business plan focused on the following key initiatives: revenue growth, price realization, productivity improvements and capital deployment.
as part of our revenue growth initiative, we remain focused on expanding market share through new product introductions and more effective utilization of sales and marketing efforts across the organization. in addition, we continue to assess opportunities to expand sales through acquisitions of businesses that fill product line gaps or allow for expansion into new markets.
price realization and productivity improvements are key areas of focus for our company. productivity programs impact virtually all functional areas within the company by rationalizing our manufacturing footprint and activities through restructuring actions, reducing or eliminating waste and improving processes. we continue to expand our efforts surrounding global product and component sourcing and supplier cost reduction programs. value engineering efforts, product transfers and the use of lean process improvement techniques are expected to continue to increase manufacturing efficiency. in addition, we continue to build upon the benefits of our enterprise resource planning system across all functions and have also implemented a sustainability program across the organization. material costs are approximately two-thirds of our cost of goods sold therefore volatility in this area can significantly impact profitability. our goal is to have pricing and productivity programs that offset material and other inflationary cost increases as well as pay for investments in key growth areas.
outlook for 2015, we expect our overall net sales to increase by five to seven percent compared to 2014, with acquisitions contributing between five and six percent. our outlook for net sales growth from acquisitions in 2015 includes the acquisitions we completed in january 2015, which are expected to add approximately $100 million to annual net sales.
third party forecasts for our end markets point to improving organic demand in each of our businesses, with the exception of significantly weaker energy related markets. we expect our end markets could grow approximately one to two percent in 2015 led by high single digit growth in the residential market. the non-residential market is expected to grow in the mid-single digit range, industrial market growth is expected to be in the low to mid-single digit range, while transmission and distribution products in the utility market are anticipated to grow by one to two percent. we anticipate our net sales could benefit from growth in these end markets, but could also be dampened by a fifteen to twenty percent decline in the net sales of our harsh and hazardous products in 2015, which reflects an expectation of continued weakness in energy related markets.
we plan to continue to work on productivity initiatives and to make other strategic investments aimed at improving our cost structure and operating efficiency, including improved sourcing, product redesign and lean projects focused on both factory and back office efficiencies. in 2015 we plan to continue and expand on restructuring activities that were initiated in 2014. in 2015 we expect our earnings per diluted share will include approximately $0.25 cents of restructuring and related costs and anticipate those activities and investments will generate savings in 2016 in excess of those costs. we also anticipate continued cost increases from certain materials, healthcare and other inflationary costs, including higher pension costs.
from a profitability standpoint, we expect organic sales growth and acquisitions will contribute to earnings per share growth in 2015; however that growth will be partially offset by weak end markets for our harsh and hazardous products relating to the recent decline in oil prices. additionally, we expect that foreign exchange will also be a headwind in 2015. we expect that our full year diluted earnings per share in 2015 will be in the range of $5.35 to $5.55, including approximately $0.25 of restructuring and related costs.
in 2015, we expect free cash flow (defined as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures) to be approximately 90% of net income and will include the impact of increased spending in 2015 on restructuring and related activities as well as higher capital spending on new product development.
finally, with our strong financial position, we expect to continue to enhance shareholder value through capital deployment including both share repurchases and acquisitions. we anticipate that our 2015 acquisitions will contribute incremental earnings, but will be approximately 30 basis points dilutive to operating margin in 2015 as those acquisitions are burdened in the early periods with the impact of purchase accounting amortization.

back to contents results of operations our operations are classified into two reportable segments: electrical and power. for a complete description of the company's segments, see part i, item 1 of this annual report on form 10-k. within these segments, hubbell primarily serves customers in the non-residential and residential construction, industrial and utility markets. the company's served markets, in order of magnitude of net sales for the company, are primarily non-residential construction, industrial, utility and to a lesser extent, residential construction.
in 2014, our overall end markets improved slightly. our largest end market, non-residential construction, grew on the continued strength of the renovation and relights markets as well as increased demand for private construction spending. the residential market also grew in 2014, albeit at a more modest pace than the past several years. the industrial market was mixed in 2014 as increased spending for maintenance, repairs and operations (mro) was offset by flat demand for our harsh and hazardous businesses and weaker demand for high voltage test equipment. the utility market grew modestly in 2014 on slightly higher spending for distribution and transmission products.
summary of consolidated results (in millions, except per share data)
for the year ending december 31,
gross profit                                1,109.0           33.0   %             1,070.5           33.6   %             1,012.2           33.2   %
net sales net sales for the year ended 2014 were $3.4 billion, an increase of six percent over the year ended 2013. acquisitions added four percentage points to net sales in 2014 compared to 2013 while volume increased net sales by two percentage points. price realization was flat and foreign currency translation was slightly negative and not significant to the year over year change in net sales.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased to 67.0% for 2014 compared to 66.4% in 2013. the increase was primarily due to unfavorable business and product mix, higher material costs, and cost inflation in excess of productivity, including approximately 10 basis points from higher warranty and related costs in the electrical segment incurred in the third quarter of 2014.
gross profit the gross profit margin for 2014 declined to 33.0% compared to 33.6% in 2013. the decrease was primarily due to unfavorable business and product mix, higher material costs, and cost inflation in excess of productivity, including approximately 10 basis points from higher warranty and related costs in the electrical segment incurred in the third quarter of 2014.
s&a expense increased five percent compared to 2013 primarily due to the addition of s&a expense of acquired businesses. as a percentage of net sales, s&a expense declined to 17.6% in 2014 compared to 17.7% in 2013 primarily due to the favorable impact of volume leverage.
operating income operating income increased two percent in 2014 to $517.4 million, while operating margin declined by 50 basis points to 15.4%. the increase in operating income is primarily due to the favorable impact of higher organic volume and the contribution of acquisitions, which exceeded the unfavorable impact of business and product mix, and cost increases that are described within the discussion of gross profit. the increase in organic volume and contribution of acquisitions, in aggregate, were not significant to operating margin.
total other expense in 2014, total other expense, which is primarily interest expense on long-term debt, was $31.9 million compared to $33.8 million in 2013. the $1.9 million decrease was primarily due to lower hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   17
back to contents net foreign currency transaction losses in 2014 compared to 2013.
income taxes the effective tax rate in 2014 was 32.6% compared to 30.4% in 2013. the increase in the tax rate for 2014 was due primarily to the benefit in 2013 of the retroactive application of certain 2012 tax provisions, including the research and development tax credit, that were part of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which became law during the first quarter of 2013, a comparative increase in domestic earnings and decrease in foreign earnings in low tax jurisdictions, as well as certain discrete tax items. additional information related to the company's effective tax rate is included in note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
net income attributable to hubbell and earnings per diluted share for the reasons described above, net income attributable to hubbell decreased 0.4% in 2014. earnings per diluted share in 2014 increased 0.2% compared to 2013 as the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the year were lower by approximately 0.4 million as compared to 2013.
net sales in the electrical segment increased six percent in 2014 compared with 2013 due to acquisitions and higher organic volume. acquisitions added almost four percentage points and organic volume almost three percentage points to net sales. price realization was positive but not significant and was offset by the impact of negative foreign currency translation.
within the segment, electrical systems products net sales increased five percent in 2014 compared to 2013 due to acquisitions and higher organic volume. price realization was positive but not significant and was offset by the impact of negative foreign currency translation. higher organic net sales of electrical systems products was driven by strength in our wiring, connectors and grounding products that support the non-residential and residential construction markets, partially offset by weak demand for our high voltage test equipment and harsh and hazardous products that support the extractive industries. net sales of lighting products increased eight percent in 2014 compared to 2013 due to acquisitions and strong organic volume in the non-residential market, which continued to benefit from increased relight and retrofit renovation project demand, and growth in the residential market.
operating income in 2014 was $337.9 million, a one percent decrease compared to 2013, while operating margin declined by 100 basis points to 14.1%. the decline in operating margin reflects cost inflation in excess of productivity, including approximately 20 basis points from restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2014, and unfavorable business and product mix, partially offset by higher organic volume and price realization. operating margin for the year ended 2014 also includes higher warranty and related costs which were incurred in the third quarter of 2014, and contributed approximately 15 basis points to the decline. the decrease in operating income can be attributed to these factors and also includes the contribution of acquisitions, which were 10 basis points dilutive to operating margin.
net sales in the power segment increased four percent in 2014 compared to 2013 due to acquisitions and organic volume. acquisitions contributed four percentage points to net sales and organic volume contributed two percentage points. higher organic volume was driven by modest growth in distribution and transmission spending. price realization was negative and foreign currency translation was unfavorable, each by one percentage point.
operating income increased eight percent to $179.5 million and operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 18.7% in 2014 compared to 2013. the increase in operating margin reflects productivity in excess of cost inflation and lower facility closure costs in 2014, partially offset by higher material costs and negative price realization. the increase in operating income can be attributed to these factors and also includes the contribution of acquisitions, which were 20 basis points dilutive to operating margin.
net sales net sales for the year ended 2013 were $3.2 billion, an increase of five percent over the year ended 2012. acquisitions added three percentage points to net sales in 2013 compared to 2012 while volume increased net sales by two percentage points. price realization was offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation, each less than one percentage point.
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold decreased to 66.4% for 2013 compared to 66.8% in 2012. the decrease was primarily due to productivity in excess of other cost increases, favorable price realization and slightly lower material costs. lower material costs for commodities such as copper, steel and aluminum more than offset higher costs for resins, chemicals, purchased finished goods and value added components.

back to contents gross profit the gross profit margin for 2013 expanded to 33.6% compared to 33.2% in 2012. the increase was primarily due to productivity in excess of other cost increases, favorable price realization and slightly lower material costs. lower material costs for commodities such as copper, steel and aluminum more than offset higher costs for resins, chemicals, purchased finished goods and value added components, as described above.
s&a expense increased four percent compared to 2012 primarily due to the impact of the businesses acquired. higher costs for wages, benefits, legal and advertising were almost entirely offset by lower pension costs and other spending reductions. as a percentage of net sales, s&a expenses remained constant at 17.7% in 2013 compared to 2012.
operating income operating income increased eight percent to $507.6 million primarily due to higher net sales and gross profit partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs, as described above. operating margin of 15.9% in 2013 increased 40 basis points compared to 15.5% in 2012 as a result of productivity, lower material costs and price realization, partially offset by other inflationary increases.
total other expense in 2013, total other expense was $33.8 million compared to $30.0 million in 2012. the $3.8 million increase was primarily due to higher net foreign currency transaction losses in 2013 compared to 2012.
income taxes the effective tax rate in 2013 was 30.4% compared to 31.6% in 2012. the lower tax rate for 2013 was due primarily to both the current year and retroactive application of certain tax provisions, including the research and development tax credit that were part of the american taxpayer relief act of 2012, which became law during the first quarter of 2013. additional information related to the company's effective tax rate is included in note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
net income attributable to hubbell and earnings per diluted share for the reasons described above, net income attributable to hubbell and earnings per diluted share in 2013 each increased nine percent compared to 2012. the average number of diluted shares outstanding for the year were lower by approximately 0.2 million as compared to 2012.
net sales in the electrical segment increased seven percent in 2013 compared with 2012 due to acquisitions and higher organic volume. acquisitions and organic volume added four and three percentage points, respectively, to net sales. in addition, price realization was offset by the negative impacts of foreign currency translation, each less than one percentage point.
within the segment, electrical systems products net sales increased seven percent in 2013 compared to 2012 due to acquisitions and slightly higher organic demand. favorable price realization was offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation. higher net sales of electrical systems products included growth in high voltage projects and improvements in the construction sector. the extractive industries sector was essentially flat while industrial demand was lower. net sales of lighting products increased eight percent in 2013 compared to 2012 due to strong organic volume growth in the non-residential market, which continued to benefit from increased relight and retrofit renovation project demand, strong growth in the residential market and the impact of the norlux acquisition.
operating income in 2013 increased twelve percent to $341.1 million compared to 2012 while operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 15.1%. operating income increased primarily due to acquisitions, higher volume and favorable price realization partially offset by unfavorable product mix driven by lower industrial demand. in addition, productivity exceeded all other cost increases. operating margin improved primarily due to productivity in excess of cost increases, lower material costs and favorable price realization.
net sales in the power segment declined one percent in 2013 compared to 2012. the decrease was due to lower organic volume and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation largely offset by the impact of an acquisition. the acquisition contributed two percentage points to net sales, while hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   19
back to contents the decline in organic volume and impact of foreign currency translation decreased net sales by two and one percentage points, respectively. the organic volume decline was almost entirely due to the impact of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 related to superstorm sandy.
operating income decreased one percent to $166.5 million and operating margin remained at 18.1% in 2013 compared to 2012. the drop in operating income was primarily due to lower volume, unfavorable price realization, higher material costs and other cost increases, including $5.0 million of facility consolidation costs, partially offset by productivity improvements and favorable product mix.

cash provided by operating activities for 2014 increased compared to 2013 primarily due to higher net income after adjusting for the non-cash impacts of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and deferred income taxes, and a lower use of cash for working capital, partially offset by higher pension contributions. cash used for changes in working capital was $44.7 million in 2014 compared to $55.1 million of cash used in 2013 primarily due to increased collection of accounts receivable.
cash used for investing activities of $242.6 million in 2014 compared to cash used of $151.1 million in 2013. this increase is primarily due to an $87.3 million increase in net cash used for acquisitions in 2014 as compared to 2013.
cash used for financing activities of $215.6 million in 2014 compared to $130.9 million of cash used in 2013. this increase is primarily the result of $74.5 million of higher spending on the repurchase of common shares and an $11.9 million increase in dividends paid.
the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates on cash increased to $20.1 million in 2014 as compared to $4.1 million in 2013 primarily related to the u.s. dollar strengthening against several currencies, most notably the british pound, australian dollar, mexican peso and canadian dollar.
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2013 increased compared to 2012 primarily due to higher net income and lower pension contributions, partially offset by a greater use of cash for working capital. cash used for changes in working capital was $55.1 million in 2013 compared to $45.3 million of cash used in 2012 primarily due to higher accounts receivable as a result of increased net sales.
investing activities used cash of $151.1 million in 2013 compared to cash used of $116.1 million in 2012. the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures, net acquisition investments and lower proceeds from sales of available for sale investments in 2013 as compared to 2012.
financing activities used cash of $130.9 million in 2013 compared to cash used of $161.7 million in 2012. the decrease in cash used is due to a lower spending on the repurchase of common shares, lower proceeds from the exercise of stock options and fewer dividend payments in 2013 as compared to 2012. in 2013, the company made four dividend payments as compared to five dividend payments made in 2012.
investments in the business investments in our business include both expenditures required to maintain the operation of our equipment and facilities as well as cash outlays in support of our strategic initiatives. during 2014, we used cash of $60.3 million for capital expenditures, an increase of $1.5 million from 2013.
in 2014, the company completed seven acquisitions for $183.8 million, net of cash acquired. four of these acquisitions were added to the power segment, while three were added to the electrical segment. in january 2015, the company completed three acquisitions for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately $126 million. two of these acquisitions were added to the electrical segment, while one was added to the power segment. the company continues to assess hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   20

in september 2011, the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program and authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of class a and class b common stock. during 2014, the company spent $35.0 million on the repurchase of common shares under the september 2011 program prior to its expiration in september 2014. in october 2014, the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the "october 2014 program") and authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of class a and class b common stock. the october 2014 program expires in october 2017. as of december 31, 2014, approximately $229.5 million remains authorized for future repurchases under the october 2014 program. depending upon numerous factors, including market conditions and alternative uses of cash, we may conduct discretionary repurchases through open market and privately negotiated transactions during our normal trading windows.
additional information with respect to future investments in the business can be found under "outlook" within management's discussion and analysis.
debt to capital at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had $597.6 million and $597.2 million, respectively, of senior long-term notes outstanding, net of unamortized discount. the long-term fixed-rate notes, with amounts of $300 million due in 2018 and 2022, respectively, are callable with a make whole provision and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity if we fail to meet certain non-financial covenants, all of which were met at december 31, 2014.
at december 31, 2014 and 2013, the company had $1.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively, of short-term debt outstanding. during 2013, the company entered into a credit agreement for a 5.0 million brazilian reais line of credit to support its brazilian operations. this line of credit expires in october 2016; however, any undrawn balance is subject to an annual review by the lender. this line is not subject to annual commitment fees. at december 31, 2014, 3.0 million brazilian reais (equivalent to $1.1 million) was outstanding. there were no borrowings outstanding at december 31, 2013 under this line of credit. short-term debt is also comprised of outstanding borrowings of 1.7 million chinese renminbi (equivalent to $0.3 million) under existing lines of credit used to support its operations in china. at december 31, 2013 there were 2.1 million chinese renminbi (equivalent to $0.3 million) of borrowings outstanding under this line of credit.
net debt, defined as total debt less cash and investments, is a non-gaap measure that may not be comparable to definitions used by other companies. we consider net debt to be a useful measure of our financial leverage for evaluating the company's ability to meet its funding needs.
the following table sets forth the reconciliation of net debt at december 31, 2014 and 2013:

in november 2010, the company completed a public debt offering for $300 million of long-term, senior, unsecured notes maturing in november 2022 ("2022 notes") and bearing interest at a fixed rate of 3.625%. prior to the issuance of the 2022 notes, the company entered into a forward interest rate lock which resulted in a $1.6 million loss. this amount was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and is being amortized over the life of the 2022 notes.
in may 2008, the company completed a public offering of $300 million long-term senior, unsecured notes maturing in may 2018 (the "2018 notes"). the 2018 notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.95%. prior to the issuance of the 2018 notes, the company entered into a forward interest rate lock which resulted in a $1.2 million gain. this amount was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and is being amortized over the life of the notes.
the 2018 notes and the 2022 notes are both fixed rate indebtedness, are callable at any time with a make whole premium and are only subject to accelerated payment prior to maturity in the event of a default under the indenture governing the terms of the 2018 notes and 2022 notes, as modified by the supplemental indentures creating each such series, or upon a change in control event as defined in such indenture.
liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short-term and long-term operational funding needs, fund additional investments, including acquisitions, and make dividend payments to shareholders. significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, cash dividend payments, stock repurchases, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.

back to contents the company had $653.9 million of cash and cash equivalents at december 31, 2014, of which approximately 53% was held outside of the united states. except for a portion of current earnings, the company's intent is to indefinitely reinvest all of its undistributed international earnings and cash internationally. in january 2015 the company completed three acquisitions for an aggregate cash purchase price of $126 million. further discussion of the january 2015 acquisitions can be found in note 22 - subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
as of december 31, 2014, the company's $500 million revolving credit facility had not been drawn against. the credit facility, which serves as a backup to our commercial paper program, is scheduled to expire in march 2018. the interest rate applicable to borrowing under the credit agreement is generally either the prime rate or a surcharge over libor. the single financial covenant in the $500 million credit facility, which the company is in compliance with, requires that total debt not exceed 55% of total capitalization. annual commitment fees to support availability under the credit facility are not material.
although not the principal source of liquidity, we believe our credit facility is capable of providing significant financing flexibility at reasonable rates of interest. however, in the event of a significant deterioration in the results of our operations or cash flows, leading to deterioration in financial condition, our borrowing costs could increase and/or our ability to borrow could be restricted. we have not entered into any guarantees that could give rise to material unexpected cash requirements.
the company also maintains other lines of credit that are primarily used to support the issuance of letters of credit. interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country, depending on local market conditions. at december 31, 2014 and 2013 these lines totaled $54.6 million and $60.4 million, respectively, of which $27.1 million and $22.9 million was utilized to support letters of credit and the remaining amount was unused. the annual commitment fees associated with these lines of credit are not material.
internal cash generation together with currently available cash and investments, available borrowing facilities and credit lines, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, the current rate of cash dividends, capital expenditures, and an increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity for the foreseeable future. we actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current businesses. while a significant acquisition may require additional debt and/or equity financing, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our favorable historical earnings performance and strong financial position.
pension funding status we have a number of funded and unfunded non-contributory u.s. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. benefits under these plans are generally provided based on either years of service and final average pay or a specified dollar amount per year of service. the funded status of our qualified, defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors including future returns on invested pension assets, the level of market interest rates, employee earnings and employee demographics.
changes in the value of the defined benefit plan assets and liabilities will affect the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized. although differences between actuarial assumptions and actual results are no longer deferred for balance sheet purposes, deferral is still permitted for pension expense purposes. unrecognized gains and losses in excess of an annual calculated minimum amount (the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market value of assets) are amortized and recognized in net periodic pension cost over the average remaining service period of our active employees, which approximates 10-12 years. during 2014 and 2013, we recorded $3.9 million and $13.8 million, respectively, of pension expense related to the amortization of these unrecognized losses. we expect to record $12.1 million of expense related to unrecognized losses and prior service cost in 2015.
the actual return on our pension assets in 2014 and for the past ten year period has exceeded our expected return. however, over that same period there has been a significant decline in long-term interest rates and a resulting increase in our pension liabilities which has more than offset our favorable return on plan assets. in 2014 and 2012, we contributed $23.5 million and $22.6 million, respectively, to our qualified foreign and domestic defined benefit pension plans. we contributed $3.2 million to our qualified foreign defined benefit pension plans in 2013. these contributions have improved the funded status of all of our plans. although not required under the pension protection act of 2006, the company made a voluntary contribution to its qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan of $20.0 million in january 2015. we do not anticipate further contributions to the qualified domestic defined benefit pension plan in 2015. the company expects to contribute approximately $3.0 million to its foreign plans in 2015. the anticipated 2015 level of pension funding is not expected to have a significant impact on our overall liquidity.

expected return on plan assets                                                                          6.06   %      6.70   %           n/a          n/a rate of compensation increase                                                                           3.18   %      3.11   %          4.50     %   3.00   %
at the end of each year, we estimate the expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets based on the strategic asset allocation for our plans. in making this determination, we utilize expected rates of return for each asset class based upon current market conditions and expected risk premiums for each asset class. a one percentage point change in the expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets would have an impact of approximately $8.4 million on 2015 pretax pension expense. the expected long-term rate of return is applied to the fair market value of pension fund assets to produce the expected return on fund assets that is included in pension expense. the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets was recognized at december 31, 2014 for balance sheet purposes, but continues to be deferred for expense purposes. the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately affects future pension expense through the amortization of gains (losses) with an offsetting adjustment to hubbell shareholders' equity through accumulated other comprehensive loss.
at the end of each year, we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities. for our u.s. and canadian pension plans, this discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows associated with our benefit obligations to a yield curve based on high quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that closely match the expected funding period of our pension liabilities. this yield curve is derived using a bond matching approach which incorporates a selection of bonds that align with our projected benefit obligations. as of december 31, 2014, we used a discount rate of 4.3% for our u.s. pension plans compared to a discount rate of 5.1% used in 2013. for our canadian pension plan, we used a discount rate of 3.95% in 2014, compared to the 4.75% discount rate used in 2013.
for our uk pension plan the discount rate was derived using a yield curve fitted to the yields on aa bonds in the barclays capital sterling aggregate corporate index and uses sample plan cash flow data as a proxy to plan specific liability cash flows. the derived discount rate is the single discount rate equivalent to discounting these liability cash flows at the term-dependent spot rates of aa corporate bonds. this methodology resulted in a december 31, 2014 discount rate for the uk pension plan of 3.7% as compared to a discount rate of 4.6% used in 2013.
in 2014 we changed the mortality table used to calculate the present value of our pension plan liabilities from rp-2000 to the rp-2000 with generational projection using scale bb-2d. this mortality table was chosen after considering alternative tables including the rp-2014 projected with scale mp-2014. we chose the rp-2000 with scale bb-2d because it resulted in the closest match to the plans' actual experience over the period 2009-2013. this change resulted in an approximately $40 million increase in the projected benefit obligation of our u.s. defined benefit pension plans upon remeasurement at december 31, 2014.
other post employment benefits ("opeb")
the company also has a number of health care and life insurance benefit plans covering eligible employees who reached retirement age while working for the company. these benefits have been discontinued for substantially all future retirees. these plans are not funded and, therefore, no assumed rate of return on assets is required. we use a similar methodology to derive the yield curve for our post employment benefit plan obligations that we use for our pension plans. as of december 31, 2014, the company used a discount rate of 4.10% to determine the projected benefit obligation compared to a discount rate of 4.6% used in 2013. in accordance with the accounting guidance for retirement benefits, we recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss, within hubbell shareholders' equity, a charge net of tax of approximately $1.7 million in 2014 and a credit, net of tax, of approximately $0.2 million in 2013, related to the opeb plans.
off-balance sheet arrangements off-balance sheet arrangements are defined as any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not included in our consolidated results is a party, under which we, whether or not a party to the arrangement, have, or hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   23

(b)   amounts above reflect projected funding related to the company's non-qualified defined benefit plans. projected funding obligations of the company's qualified defined benefit pension plans are excluded from the table as there are significant factors, such as the future market value of plan assets and projected investment return rates, which could cause actual funding requirements to differ materially from projected funding.
our purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders for goods and services with defined terms as to price, quantity, delivery and termination liability. these obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements and commitments for equipment purchases. as of december 31, 2014, we have $21.6 million of uncertain tax positions reflected in our consolidated balance sheet. we are unable to make a reasonable estimate regarding the timing of settlement of these uncertain tax positions and, as a result, they have been excluded from the table. see note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
critical accounting estimates note 1 - significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements.
use of estimates we are required to make assumptions and estimates and apply judgments in the preparation of our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. we base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors deemed relevant by management. we continually review these estimates and their underlying assumptions to ensure they are appropriate for the circumstances. changes in estimates and assumptions used by us could have a material impact on our financial results. we believe that the following estimates are among the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. these items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are based on our judgment.
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price is determinable and collection is probable. product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. the majority of our revenue is recognized at the time of shipment. certain of our businesses account for sales discounts and allowances based on sales volumes, specific programs and customer deductions as is customary in the electrical products industry. these items primarily relate to sales volume incentives, special pricing allowances, and returned goods. this requires us to estimate at the time of sale the amounts that should not be recorded as revenue as these amounts are not expected to be collected from customers. we principally rely on historical experience, specific customer agreements, and anticipated future trends to estimate these amounts at the time of shipment.
inventory valuation we routinely evaluate the carrying value of our inventories to ensure they are carried at the lower of cost or market value. such evaluation is based on our judgment and use of estimates, including sales forecasts, gross margins for particular product groupings, planned dispositions of product lines, technological events and overall industry trends. in addition, the evaluation is based on changes in inventory management practices which may influence the timing of exiting products and method of disposing of excess inventory.

back to contents excess inventory is generally identified by comparing future expected inventory usage to actual on-hand quantities. inventory values are reduced for on-hand inventory in excess of pre-defined usage forecasts. forecast usage is primarily determined by projecting historical (actual) sales and inventory usage levels forward to future periods. changes in these estimates may necessitate future adjustments to inventory values.
customer credit and collections we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable in order to reflect the potential uncollectability of receivables related to purchases of products on open credit. if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make required payments, we may be required to record additional allowances for doubtful accounts.
accrued insurance we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers' compensation, medical, automobile and general liability insurance. we estimate self-insurance liabilities using a number of factors, including historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based upon our estimates of ultimate costs to settle known claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. these assumptions are periodically reviewed with a third-party actuary to determine the adequacy of these self-insurance reserves. changes in these assumptions may necessitate future adjustments to these self-insurance liabilities.
employee benefits costs and funding we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension, defined contribution and other postretirement plans. major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on the pension fund assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections. these assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year as of the plans' measurement date. further discussion of the assumptions used in 2014 and 2013 are included above under "pension funding status" and in note 10 - retirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements.
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. additionally, deferred tax assets are required to be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets are the forecast of future taxable income, available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets, and future reversals of deferred tax liabilities. failure to achieve forecasted taxable income can affect the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets.
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. the internal revenue service ("irs") and other tax authorities routinely review our tax returns. these audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve. the company records uncertain tax positions only when it has determined that it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. the company uses the criteria established in the accounting guidance to determine whether an item meets the definition of more-likely-than-not. the company's policy is to recognize these uncertain tax positions when the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, when the statute of limitations has expired or upon settlement. in management's opinion, adequate provision has been made for potential adjustments arising from any examinations. see also note 12 - income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements.
contingent liabilities we are subject to proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims or uncertainties related to environmental, legal, product and other matters. we routinely assess the likelihood of an adverse judgment or outcome to these matters, as well as the range of potential losses. we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. a determination of the reserves required, if any, is made after careful analysis, including consultations with outside advisors, where applicable. where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments.
valuation of long-lived assets our long-lived assets include land, buildings, equipment, molds and dies, software, goodwill and other intangible assets. long-lived assets, other than land, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. goodwill represents purchase price in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. intangible assets primarily consist of patents, tradenames and customer related intangibles.
we review depreciable long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. if such a change in circumstances occurs, the related estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is compared to the carrying amount. if the sum of the expected cash flows of the asset group is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recorded. the impairment charge is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. the fair value of impaired assets is determined using expected cash flow estimates, quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate. we did not record any material impairment charges related to long-lived assets in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment unless circumstances dictate the need hubbell incorporated - form 10-k   25
back to contents for more frequent assessment. we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of april 1st of each year unless circumstances dictate the need for more frequent assessments. the accounting guidance provides entities an option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing a quantitative analysis. if the entity determines, on the basis of certain qualitative factors, that it is more-likely-than-not that the goodwill is not impaired, the entity would not need to proceed to the two step goodwill impairment testing process as prescribed in the guidance. the company has elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceeded directly to the quantitative analysis. the goodwill impairment testing requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future discounted cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. we use internal discounted cash flow estimates to determine fair value. these cash flow estimates are derived from historical experience and future long-term business plans and the application of an appropriate discount rate. changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. as of april 1, 2014, our goodwill testing resulted in fair values for each reporting unit that substantially exceeded the reporting unit's carrying value. we have not recorded any goodwill impairments since the initial adoption of the accounting guidance in 2002.
the identification and measurement of impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets involves an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. if it is more likely than not that the asset is imparied, the fair value of the indefinite lived intangibles will be determined using discounted cash flow estimates. if the carrying value of these assets exceeds the estimated fair value, the carrying value will be reduced to the estimated fair value. we did not record any impairments related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2014, 2013, or 2012.
stock-based compensation we determine the grant date fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using either a lattice model or the black-scholes option pricing model. both of these models require management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. these inputs include assumptions for the expected term, stock volatility, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. changes in these inputs impact fair value and could impact our stock-based compensation expense in the future. in addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions. if our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, adjustments to stock-based compensation expense may be required. see also note 17 - stock-based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

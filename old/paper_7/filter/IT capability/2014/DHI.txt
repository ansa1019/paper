item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations - fiscal year 2014 overview during fiscal 2014, demand for new homes reflected stable to moderately improved trends across most of our operating markets. the significant increases in new home prices that occurred in many markets during fiscal 2013 moderated during fiscal 2014, as new home prices became less affordable to some buyers and as the supply of new homes increased. while most of our operating markets are relatively stable, we see varying levels of strength in new home demand and home prices across our markets, with demand in each market generally reflecting the relative strength of each market's economy, as measured by job growth, household incomes, household formations and consumer confidence.
our position as the largest and most geographically diverse builder in the united states provides a strong platform for us to compete for new home sales. over the past two years, we significantly increased our land, lot and home inventories by $3.5 billion across our markets, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. in fiscal 2013, we introduced our emerald homes brand to expand our product offerings to include more move-up and luxury homes. in fiscal 2014, we introduced our express homes brand to offer more affordable homes for entry-level buyers, who we believe have been under-served in the new home market recently. both of these new offerings are being introduced across our operating markets over the next year, which will significantly broaden our product diversity.
in fiscal 2014, the number and value of our net sales orders increased 18% and 27%, respectively, compared to the prior year, and the number of homes closed and home sales revenues increased 19% and 30%, respectively. we generated pre-tax income of $814.2 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $657.8 million in fiscal 2013 and $242.9 million in fiscal 2012. these results reflect the improved housing market conditions over the past two years and strong performance from our homebuilding and financial services operations. we believe our business is well-positioned to continue to grow profitably due to our broad geographic operating base and product offerings, our increased inventory position of finished lots, land and homes and our strong balance sheet and liquidity. we are focused on operating each of our communities to optimize the returns on our inventory investments by effectively managing our product offerings, home prices, incentives, sales pace, profit margins and inventory levels.
we believe that housing demand in our individual operating markets is tied closely to each market's economy; therefore, we expect that housing market conditions will vary across our markets. the u.s. economy continues to slowly improve, which we expect will allow slow to moderate overall growth in housing demand, concentrated in markets where job growth is occurring. the pace and sustainability of new home demand and our future results could be negatively affected by weakening economic conditions, decreases in the level of employment and housing demand, decreased home affordability, significant increases in mortgage interest rates or tightening of mortgage lending standards.
strategy during fiscal 2014, demand for new homes has been relatively stable across most of our operating markets, with varying levels of strength in demand and home prices across our individual markets based on local economic conditions. we have used our liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to provide the capital to increase our investments in housing and land inventory, expand our product offerings, geographically expand our operations and opportunistically pursue business acquisitions. our operating strategy is focused on leveraging our strong financial and competitive position to generate strong profitability, improve cash flows and increase our returns on our inventory investments. our operating strategy includes the following initiatives:
•   maintaining a strong cash balance and overall liquidity position, and controlling our level of debt.
•   offering new home communities that appeal to a broad range of entry-level, move-up and luxury homebuyers based on consumer demand in each market.
•   modifying product offerings, sales pace, home prices and sales incentives as necessary in each of our markets to meet consumer demand, align with finished lot supply and construction activity and optimize returns on inventory investments and cash flows.
•   entering into option purchase contracts to control land and finished lots, where possible, to mitigate the risk of land ownership.
•   investing in land, land development and opportunistic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in desirable markets, while controlling the level of land and lots we own in each of our markets relative to the local new home demand.
•   managing our inventory of homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand, monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing unsold, completed homes in inventory.
•   improving the efficiency of our land development, construction, sales and other key operational activities.
our operating strategy has produced positive results in recent years and in fiscal 2014. however, we cannot provide any assurances that the initiatives listed above will continue to be successful, and we may need to adjust components of our strategy to meet future market conditions. we expect that our operating strategy will allow us to increase our profitability while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position in fiscal 2015.
•   homebuilding debt was $3.3 billion, consistent with the prior year.
•   gross homebuilding debt to total capital was 39.4%, improving from 44.6%. net homebuilding debt to total capital was 34.5%, improving from 36.3%.
•   total equity was $5.1 billion, compared to $4.1 billion.
(1)   net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.
net sales orders the value of net sales orders increased 27%, to $8,308.6 million (29,709 homes) in 2014 from $6,567.0 million (25,120 homes) in 2013, with significant increases in four of our six regions. the increases in sales order value in those regions were primarily due to increases in volume as we have expanded our operations and increased our market share in many of our markets over the past year. to a lesser extent and to varying degrees, increases in selling prices also contributed to the value of net sales orders in each region.
the number of net sales orders increased 18% and the average price of our net sales orders increased 7% to $279,700 during 2014 compared to 2013. the largest percentage increase in net sales orders occurred in our east region, reflecting the positive impact of our recent acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities, which contributed 714 net sales orders to the east region in 2014. crown communities also contributed 508 net sales orders to the southeast region in 2014. the decreases in net sales orders that occurred in our midwest and southwest regions were primarily due to decreases in sales orders in our minnesota, colorado, phoenix and albuquerque markets. we believe our business is well positioned for the future; however, our future sales volumes will depend on the economic strength of each of our operating markets and our ability to successfully implement our operating strategies in each market.
sales order backlog sales order backlog represents homes under contract but not yet closed at the end of the period. many of the contracts in our sales order backlog are subject to contingencies, including mortgage loan approval and buyers selling their existing homes, which can result in cancellations. a portion of the contracts in backlog will not result in closings due to cancellations. the largest percentage increase in our sales order backlog occurred in our east region, reflecting the positive impact of our recent acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities, which contributed 377 homes to our east region backlog at september 30, 2014. crown communities also contributed 305 homes to our southeast region backlog at september 30, 2014.
the number of homes closed in fiscal 2014 increased 19% from 2013 due to increases in four of our six regions. the most significant percentage increase occurred in our east region, reflecting the positive impact of our recent acquisitions of the homebuilding operations of regent homes and crown communities, which contributed 676 closings to the east region in 2014. crown communities also contributed 508 closings to the southeast region in 2014. excluding the impact of crown communities, the increase in homes closed in our southeast region was primarily due to increases in our jacksonville and atlanta markets. in our south central region, the highest percentage increases in homes closed occurred in our fort worth, dallas and houston markets. the increase in our west region was primarily due to increases in our bay area, portland and sacramento markets. the decrease in home closings in our southwest region was primarily due to weak demand in the phoenix market compared to a year ago, and in our midwest region the decrease was attributable to our colorado and chicago markets.
the average selling price of homes closed during 2014 was $272,200, up 9% from the $249,400 average in 2013. the level of home price increases began to moderate during fiscal 2014, a trend we expect will continue in future periods. we are focused on managing our product offerings, home prices, incentives, sales pace, profit margins and inventory levels in each community in a manner that will optimize the returns on our inventory investments.
gross profit - home sales                                                               21.3        %              20.8        %

gross profit - total homebuilding                                                       20.2        %              20.3        %
home sales gross profit gross profit from home sales increased 33%, to $1.7 billion in 2014, from $1.3 billion in 2013, and increased 50 basis points, to 21.3% as a percentage of home sales revenues. approximately 40 basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from the average selling price of our homes closed increasing by more than the average home cost, 20 basis points of the increase resulted from a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of homes sales revenues and 10 basis points of the increase resulted from lower costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue. partially offsetting these increases was a 20 basis point decrease from purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of crown communities and regent homes.
our gross profit margins during fiscal 2013 and throughout the first half of fiscal 2014 benefited significantly from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices across most of our markets, while we limited increases in construction costs. our gross profit margins also benefited from reduced interest amortized to cost of sales as our average borrowing costs declined. the increases in our average sales prices moderated in the second half of fiscal 2014, and we expect future price increases will continue to moderate, while our construction costs will likely increase. also, we have and will continue to manage the sales pace in each of our communities by adjusting the pricing, incentives and product mix to optimize the returns on our inventory investments. these factors caused our gross profit margins in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 to decline as compared to the prior year quarters and to the first two quarters of fiscal 2014. gross profit margins in future periods could be lower than fiscal 2014 levels.
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues were $53.8 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $61.1 million in 2013. we generally purchase land and lots with the intent to build and sell homes on them. however, we occasionally purchase land that includes commercially zoned parcels that we typically sell to commercial developers, and we may also sell residential lots or land parcels to manage our land and lot supply. land and lot sales occur at unpredictable intervals and varying degrees of profitability. therefore, the revenues and gross profit from land sales fluctuate from period to period. revenues in fiscal 2013 included revenue of $20.0 million from a long-term construction project for which we served as the general contractor. as of september 30, 2014, we had $26.4 million of land held for sale that we expect to sell in the next twelve months.
inventory and land option charges during fiscal 2014, we reviewed the performance and outlook for all of our land inventories and communities each quarter for indicators of potential impairment and performed detailed impairment evaluations and analyses when necessary. as of september 30, 2014, we performed detailed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of $359.8 million, and we recorded impairment charges of $18.1 million during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of impaired communities to their estimated fair value. total impairment charges during fiscal 2014 and 2013 were $75.2 million and $21.3 million, respectively.
of the total impairment charges in fiscal 2014, $49.3 million occurred in our midwest region, primarily related to communities in chicago that were purchased predominantly in 2004 through 2007 and had been previously impaired. during the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we reduced home prices and identified land parcels we intend to sell in these chicago communities in an effort to increase sales pace, reduce inventories and improve cash flows and returns. in contrast to most of our markets, the chicago housing market remains weak with sales absorptions and returns in these communities performing below our expectations given the size of our investments.
as we manage our inventory investments across our operating markets to optimize returns and cash flows, we may modify our pricing and incentives, construction and development plans or land sale strategies in individual active communities and land held for development, which could result in the affected communities being evaluated for potential impairment. also, if housing or economic conditions are weak in specific markets in which we operate, or if conditions weaken in the broader economy or homebuilding industry, we may be required to evaluate additional communities for potential impairment. these evaluations could result in additional impairment charges.
during fiscal 2014 and 2013, we wrote off $10.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts that are expected to be terminated. at september 30, 2014, outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled $58.7 million.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense sg&a expense from homebuilding activities increased 28% to $834.2 million in 2014 from $649.9 million in 2013. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expense decreased 10 basis points, to 10.6% in 2014 from 10.7% in 2013.
employee compensation and related costs represented 64% and 65% of sg&a costs in 2014 and 2013, respectively. these costs increased by 26%, to $536.9 million in 2014 from $425.2 million in 2013, mainly due to an increase in our number of employees and an increase in incentive compensation related to the increase in profitability in many of our divisions in the current year as compared to the prior year. our homebuilding operations employed approximately 4,525 and 3,600 employees at september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
variances in our homebuilding sg&a expense as a percentage of revenues can occur due to fluctuations in revenue, profit levels and our stock price. our awards of performance based units to executive management are accounted for as liability awards and are measured quarterly with changes in value recorded in compensation expense within sg&a. changes in our stock price and our performance compared to our peer group can cause significant changes in the value of these awards and in our compensation expense. compensation expense related to these liability awards was $9.1 million and $8.8 million, during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.
interest incurred comparing fiscal 2014 with 2013, interest incurred increased 8% to $185.8 million, due to an 18% increase in our average debt. interest incurred in the current year increased by a lower percentage than the increase in our average debt as a result of a decrease in the average interest rate of our debt as compared to the prior year.
we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. during a portion of fiscal 2013, our active inventory was lower than our debt level and therefore a portion of the interest incurred was reflected as interest expense. however, since the third quarter of fiscal 2013, our active inventory has exceeded our debt level, and all interest incurred has been capitalized to inventory. as a result, no interest was expensed during fiscal 2014, compared to $7.1 million during 2013. interest amortized to cost of sales declined to 2.0% of total home and land/lot and other cost of sales in fiscal 2014 from 2.3% in fiscal 2013 due to the growth in our active inventory relative to our debt balance and a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt. we do not expect interest amortized to cost of sales as a percentage of total home and land/lot cost of sales to decline as significantly in future periods.
other income other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $13.1 million in fiscal 2014, compared to $14.9 million in 2013. other income consists of interest income, rental income, income from insurance related activities, income associated with other income-producing assets, and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations. the activities that result in this ancillary income or loss are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.
acquisitions in october 2013, we acquired the homebuilding operations of regent homes, inc. for $34.5 million in cash. regent homes operates in charlotte, greensboro and winston-salem, north carolina. the assets acquired included approximately 240 homes in inventory, 300 lots and control of approximately 600 additional lots through option contracts. we also acquired a sales order backlog of 213 homes valued at $31.1 million. subsequent to the acquisition, regent homes closed 463 homes and generated home sales revenues of $69.4 million during fiscal 2014.
in may 2014, we acquired the homebuilding operations of crown communities for $209.6 million in cash. crown communities operates in georgia, south carolina and eastern alabama. the assets acquired included approximately 640 homes in inventory, 2,350 lots and control of approximately 3,400 additional lots through option contracts. we also acquired a sales order backlog of 431 homes valued at $113.6 million. subsequent to the acquisition, crown communities closed 721 homes and generated home sales revenues of $187.7 million during fiscal 2014.
(1)   expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office. the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the segment's revenue, while those expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each segment based on the segment's inventory balances.
east region - homebuilding revenues increased 39% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to an increase in the number of homes closed in our charlotte market due to our acquisition of regent homes in october 2013, which added 463 closings to the fiscal 2014 results. the region also benefited from our acquisition of crown communities in may 2014, which added 213 closings to the region's fiscal 2014 results. the region generated pre-tax income of $45.2 million in 2014, compared to $48.3 million in 2013. fiscal 2014 pre-tax income was reduced by inventory impairment charges of $17.7 million, primarily in our suburban washington, d.c. market. gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) decreased 120 basis points in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013, largely due to purchase accounting adjustments for the two acquisitions. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses decreased by 70 basis points in 2014 due to the increase in revenues.
midwest region - homebuilding revenues increased 3% in 2014 compared to 2013, due to an increase in the average selling price of homes closed, while the number of homes closed decreased, particularly in our denver market. the region generated a pre-tax loss of $9.5 million in 2014, compared to pre-tax income of $38.9 million in 2013, largely due to $49.3 million of inventory impairments, primarily in our chicago market. home sales gross profit percentage increased 110 basis points in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. the region's home sales gross profit percentages in both years were impacted by the timing of resolving construction defect claims and the receipt of insurance recoveries related to construction defect claims, most of which related to our denver market. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 110 basis points in fiscal 2014.
southeast region - homebuilding revenues increased 43% in 2014 compared to 2013, due to an increase in the number of homes closed as well as an increase in the average selling price in the majority of the region's markets. the increase in home closings in our jacksonville, atlanta, orlando and south florida markets contributed most to the overall increase in homebuilding revenues in the region. the region also benefited from our acquisition of crown communities in may 2014, which added 508 homes closed to the region's fiscal 2014 results. the region generated pre-tax income of $218.0 million in 2014, compared to $148.4 million in 2013, primarily as a result of increases in revenues. home sales gross profit percentage increased 50 basis points in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses decreased by 10 basis points in fiscal 2014.
south central region - homebuilding revenues increased 29% in 2014 compared to 2013, due to an increase in the number of homes closed, as well as an increase in the average selling price in the majority of the region's markets. the increase in home closings in our fort worth, dallas and houston markets contributed most to the overall increase in homebuilding revenues in the region. the region generated pre-tax income of $208.0 million in 2014, compared to $149.0 million in 2013, primarily as a result of increases in revenues. home sales gross profit percentage increased 10 basis points in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses decreased by 40 basis points in fiscal 2014 due to the increase in revenues.
southwest region - homebuilding revenues decreased 13% in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily due to a decrease in the number of homes closed in our phoenix market. the region generated pre-tax income of $25.5 million in 2014, compared to $26.3 million in 2013. home sales gross profit percentage increased 300 basis points in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. the increase was largely due to a reimbursement of development costs received from a municipality as part of a settlement during fiscal 2014, which related to a community that was completed in a prior year, as well as a decrease in expenses related to construction defect settlements. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses increased by 240 basis points in fiscal 2014 due to the decrease in revenues.
west region - homebuilding revenues increased 29% in 2014 compared to 2013, due to an increase in the average selling price of homes closed as well as an increase in the number of homes closed. the increase in home closings and average selling price in our northern california markets contributed most to the overall increase in homebuilding revenues in the region. the region generated pre-tax income of $281.6 million in 2014, compared to $181.4 million in 2013, primarily as a result of increases in revenues. home sales gross profit percentage increased 120 basis points in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses decreased by 10 basis points in fiscal 2014 compared to the prior year.
inventories, land and lot position and homes in inventory we routinely enter into land/lot option contracts to purchase land or finished lots at predetermined prices on a defined schedule commensurate with planned development or anticipated new home demand. we also purchase undeveloped land that generally is vested with the rights to begin development or construction work, and we plan and coordinate the development of our land into residential lots for use in our homebuilding business. we significantly increased our investments in land and lot acquisition and land development across all of our market regions in fiscal 2012 and 2013 to expand our operations as market conditions improved. in 2014, we slowed the growth of our land and lot inventories and increased our housing inventories to capture an increased share of new home demand and generate higher returns on our land investments. we manage our inventory of owned land and lots and homes under construction relative to demand in each of our markets, including starting construction on unsold homes to capture new home demand, monitoring the number and aging of unsold homes and aggressively marketing our unsold, completed homes in inventory.
(1)   corporate and unallocated inventory consists primarily of capitalized interest and property taxes.
our land and lot position and homes in inventory at september 30, 2014 and 2013 are summarized as follows:
(2)   the total remaining purchase price of lots controlled through land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30, 2014 and 2013 was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, secured with $58.7 million and $42.4 million in earnest money deposits. our lots controlled under land and lot option purchase contracts exclude approximately 2,200 and 2,800 lots at september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, representing lots controlled under lot option contracts for which we do not expect to exercise our option to purchase the land or lots, but the underlying contracts have yet to be terminated. we have reserved the deposits related to these contracts.
the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2014 and 2013:
recourse benefit (expense)                                                      2.2                      (0.5      )
title policy premiums, net                                                     34.9                      30.0                  16   %
recourse and reinsurance (benefit) expense             (1.2          )%                     0.3           %
mortgage loan activity the volume of loans originated and brokered by our mortgage operations is related to the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. in fiscal 2014, the volume of first-lien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 5%, while the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations increased by 19%. this was due to a decrease in our mortgage capture rate (the percentage of total home closings by our homebuilding operations for which dhi mortgage handled the homebuyers' financing) to 50% in fiscal 2014, from 56% in fiscal 2013. the decrease in capture rate was due to an increase in home closings in markets not served by dhi mortgage as well as a more competitive mortgage pricing market as compared to the prior year.
home loans to customers of our homebuilding operations constituted 88% of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2014, compared to 86% in 2013. these rates reflect dhi mortgage's consistent focus on the captive business provided by our homebuilding operations.
the number of loans sold in 2014 increased slightly from the number sold in 2013. virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2014 and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30, 2014 were eligible for sale to the fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. approximately 71% of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2014 were sold to four major financial institutions and the largest concentration of total loans sold to one institution was 28%.
financial services revenues and expenses revenues from the financial services segment decreased 4%, to $166.4 million in fiscal 2014 from $173.4 million in fiscal 2013. the volume of loans sold increased 1% while revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages decreased 11%. although loan sale volume was essentially unchanged, loan sale revenue decreased from fiscal 2013 due to pricing pressure from increased competition in the origination marketplace. in addition, loan sale execution in the prior year was unusually strong due in part to the lower interest rate environment at the time.
we had a credit of $2.2 million related to a reduction in our estimated future recourse obligations in fiscal 2014, compared to a charge of $0.5 million in fiscal 2013 related to an increase in our estimated future recourse obligations. our loss reserve for loan recourse obligations is estimated based upon an analysis of loan repurchase requests received, our actual repurchases and losses through the disposition of such loans or requests, discussions with our mortgage purchasers and analysis of the mortgages we originated. while we believe that we have adequately reserved for losses on known and projected repurchase requests, if actual repurchase volume or actual losses incurred resolving those repurchases differ from our expectations, additional recourse expense or credits may be incurred.
financial services general and administrative (g&a) expense increased 13%, to $131.2 million in 2014 from $116.4 million in 2013. as a percentage of financial services revenues (excluding the effects of recourse and reinsurance expense), g&a expense was 79.8% in 2014, compared to 66.9% in 2013 due to an increase in the number of employees to ensure adequate staffing for expected higher volumes of loan originations from the growth in our homebuilding operations and compliance with new regulatory requirements. fluctuations in financial services g&a expense as a percentage of revenues can be expected to occur, as some components of revenue may fluctuate differently than loan volumes, and some expenses are not directly related to mortgage loan volume or to changes in the amount of revenue earned.
income before income taxes pre-tax income for fiscal 2014 was $814.2 million, compared to $657.8 million for fiscal 2013. the increase in our operating income for the current year compared to a year ago is primarily due to higher revenues and home sales gross profits from increased home closings.
income taxes our income tax expense in fiscal 2014 was $280.7 million, compared to $195.1 million in 2013. our effective tax rate was 34.5% in fiscal 2014, compared to 29.7% in fiscal 2013. the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 includes a tax benefit for the domestic production activities deduction and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and the related interest. in fiscal 2013, a reduction in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, as well as a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest, contributed to the low effective tax rate.
at september 30, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $596.1 million and $617.6 million, respectively, partially offset by valuation allowances of $31.1 million and $31.0 million, respectively. the valuation allowance for both periods primarily relates to our state deferred tax assets for net operating loss (nol) carryforwards. we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of our state nol carryforwards will not be realized because some state nol carryforward periods are too brief to realize the related deferred tax assets.
at september 30, 2014, we had tax benefits of $84.5 million for state nol carryforwards that expire (beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction) from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2034. we also had state tax credit carryforwards of $5.7 million that will expire from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2024 and $1.9 million of state tax credit carryforwards that have no expiration date.
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon estimates of future results. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. also, changes in existing federal and state tax laws and tax rates could affect future tax results and the valuation of our deferred tax assets.
unrecognized tax benefits are the differences between tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefits recognized for accounting purposes. we had no unrecognized tax benefits at september 30, 2014 and $4.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits at september 30, 2013.
we classify interest expense and penalties on income taxes as income tax expense. during fiscal 2014 and 2013, we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations. at september 30, 2014, we had no accrued interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. at september 30, 2013, we had $2.2 million of accrued interest and no accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.
we are subject to federal income tax and to income tax in multiple states. the statute of limitations for our major tax jurisdictions remains open for examination for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. we are currently being audited by various states.
(1)   net sales orders represent the number and dollar value of new sales contracts executed with customers (gross sales orders), net of cancelled sales orders.
net sales orders the value of net sales orders increased 37%, to $6,567.0 million (25,120 homes) in 2013 from $4,803.3 million (21,048 homes) in 2012, with significant increases in five of our six market regions. average selling prices increased in all regions and the volume of net sales orders increased in most regions, indicating broad improvement in market conditions across our business.
the number of net sales orders increased 19% during 2013 compared to 2012, reflecting the improvement in new home demand and market conditions, as well as the effects of investments we made to expand our operations. the largest percentage increase occurred in our southeast region as a result of improved market conditions and our increased inventory investments in our atlanta, jacksonville and orlando markets. sales orders in our southeast region were also positively impacted by our acquisition of the homebuilding operations of breland homes during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which contributed 674 net sales orders in 2013, compared to 118 net sales orders in 2012. the decrease in net sales orders in our southwest region was primarily due to sales decreases in our phoenix market as compared to 2012 when significant sales
increases occurred in this market. our overall net sales volume growth moderated in the second half of the year which we believe was due in part to the impact of increases in mortgage interest rates and higher home prices, as well as our efforts to align our sales pace with our construction activities in many of our communities.
the average price of our net sales orders increased 15% to $261,400 in 2013, from $228,200 in 2012, resulting from our ability to raise sales prices in many of our communities as demand for new homes improved and the relative supply of homes for sale declined in many of our markets. a small increase in the average size of our homes sold was also a contributing factor.
sales order backlog our homes in backlog at september 30, 2013 increased 13% from the prior year, with more homes in backlog in most regions due to increases in net sales orders as compared with the prior year.
home sales revenue revenues from home sales increased 43%, to $6,024.8 million (24,155 homes closed) in 2013 from $4,218.4 million (18,890 homes closed) in 2012. during fiscal 2013, home sales revenues increased in all of our market regions, resulting from increases in the number of homes closed and increases in average selling prices due to favorable housing market conditions and our increased inventory investments.
the average selling price of homes closed during 2013 was $249,400, up 12% from the $223,300 average in 2012, resulting from our ability to raise sales prices in many of our communities as demand for new homes improved from the prior year and the supply of homes for sale declined in many of our markets. also, a small increase in the average size of our homes closed was a contributing factor.
gross profit - home sales                                                                  20.8        %              17.7        %

home sales gross profit gross profit from home sales increased by 68%, to $1.3 billion in 2013, from $745.5 million in 2012, and increased 310 basis points, to 20.8% as a percentage of home sales revenues. approximately 210 basis points of the increase in the home sales gross profit percentage resulted from reduced sales incentives and increases in the average selling price of our homes closed, partially offset by smaller increases in the average cost of our homes closed, reflecting improved market conditions. approximately 60 basis points of the increase was due to lower costs for warranty and construction defect claims as a percentage of home sales revenue. the remaining 40 basis points of the increase was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes as a percentage of home sales revenues, resulting from the decrease in interest capitalized as a percentage of our active inventory from the prior year due to a decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt and the growth in our active inventory.
our gross profit margins in fiscal 2013 benefited significantly from favorable market conditions that allowed us to increase sales prices and reduce incentives across most of our markets, while we limited increases in construction costs. our gross profit margins also benefited from reduced interest amortized to cost of sales, as our average borrowing costs benefited from the maturity of some higher interest rate debt combined with the issuance of new debt securities with lower interest rates.
land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues increased to $61.1 million in 2013, from $17.8 million in 2012. revenue from a single long-term construction project for which we served as the general contractor was included in land sales and other revenues. revenue from this project was recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis as the construction was completed. during fiscal 2013 and 2012, the revenue related to this project was $20.0 million and $6.5 million, respectively, and the gross profit was $4.4 million and $1.2 million, respectively.
inventory and land option charges as of september 30, 2013, we performed impairment evaluations of communities with a combined carrying value of $165.9 million, and we recorded impairment charges of $21.3 million during the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying values of impaired communities to their estimated fair values. total impairment charges during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were $21.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we wrote off $9.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, of earnest money deposits and pre-acquisition costs related to land option contracts that were expected to be terminated. at september 30, 2013, outstanding earnest money deposits associated with our portfolio of land and lot option purchase contracts totaled $42.4 million.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expense sg&a expense from homebuilding activities increased 23% to $649.9 million in 2013 from $528.7 million in 2012. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expense decreased 180 basis points, to 10.7% in 2013 from 12.5% in 2012. the improvement in sg&a expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to an increase in both the volume and the average selling prices of our homes closed, combined with our efforts to keep the growth in overhead expenses at a lower level than the growth in home closings volume and revenues.
employee compensation and related costs represented 65% and 63% of sg&a costs in 2013 and 2012, respectively. these costs increased by 27%, to $425.2 million in 2013 from $335.6 million in 2012, mainly due to an increase in our number of employees and an increase in the level of incentive compensation related to the significant increases in profitability in 2013 as compared to 2012. our homebuilding operations employed approximately 3,600 and 2,740 employees at september 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
our awards of performance based units to executive management are accounted for as liability awards and are measured quarterly with changes in value recorded in compensation expense within sg&a. changes in our stock price and our performance compared to our peer group can cause significant changes in the value of these awards and in our compensation expense. during fiscal 2013 and 2012, the compensation expense related to these liability awards was $8.8 million and $9.8 million, respectively.
interest incurred comparing fiscal 2013 with fiscal 2012, interest incurred increased 39% to $172.8 million, due to a 59% increase in our average debt. interest incurred in fiscal 2013 increased by a lower percentage than the increase in our average debt due to new debt issued at lower interest rates and the maturity of higher interest rate debt, both of which reduced our average interest rate as compared to the prior year.
we capitalize interest costs incurred to inventory during active development and construction (active inventory). capitalized interest is charged to cost of sales as the related inventory is delivered to the buyer. during fiscal 2012 and a portion of fiscal 2013, our active inventory was lower than our debt level and therefore, a portion of the interest incurred was reflected as interest expense. however, during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013, our active inventory exceeded our debt level and therefore, all interest incurred during those periods was capitalized to inventory. as a result, $7.1 million of interest was expensed during fiscal 2013, compared to $26.9 million during 2012. interest amortized to cost of sales declined to 2.3% of total home and land/lot and other cost of sales in fiscal 2013 from 2.7% in fiscal 2012 as a result of a decrease in interest capitalized as a percentage of our active inventory from the prior year due to the decrease in the average interest rate on our outstanding debt and the growth in our active inventory.
other income other income, net of other expenses, included in our homebuilding operations was $14.9 million in 2013, compared to $12.2 million in 2012. other income consists of interest income, rental income, income from insurance related activities, income associated with other income-producing assets, and various other types of ancillary income, gains, expenses and losses not directly associated with our core homebuilding operations. the activities that result in this ancillary income or loss are not significant, either individually or in the aggregate.
acquisitions in august 2012, we acquired the homebuilding operations of breland homes for $105.9 million in cash, of which $9.4 million was paid in fiscal 2013. breland homes operates in huntsville and mobile, alabama and along the coast of mississippi. the assets acquired included approximately 300 homes in inventory, 1,000 lots and control of approximately 3,700 additional lots through option contracts. we also acquired a sales order backlog of 228 homes valued at $46.9 million.
(1)   expenses maintained at the corporate level consist primarily of interest and property taxes, which are capitalized and amortized to cost of sales or expensed directly, and the expenses related to operating our corporate office. the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes is allocated to each segment based on the segment's revenue, while those expenses associated with the corporate office are allocated to each segment based on the segment's inventory balances.
east region - homebuilding revenues increased 27% in 2013 compared to 2012, due to an increase in the average selling price and the number of homes closed in the majority of the region's markets. the increase in home closings in our south carolina markets contributed most to the overall increase in the region. the region generated pre-tax income of $48.3 million in 2013, compared to $16.0 million in 2012, primarily as a result of increases in revenues and gross profit. gross profit from home sales as a percentage of home sales revenue (home sales gross profit percentage) increased 270 basis points in fiscal 2013, compared to fiscal 2012. as a percentage of homebuilding revenues, sg&a expenses decreased by 70 basis points in 2013 due to the increase in revenues.

the following tables set forth key operating and financial data for our financial services operations, comprising dhi mortgage and our subsidiary title companies, for the fiscal years ended september 30, 2013 and 2012:
title policy premiums, net                                                     30.0                      23.7                  27      %
mortgage loan activity in fiscal 2013, total first-lien loans originated or brokered by dhi mortgage for our homebuyers increased by 20%, due to an increase of 28% in the number of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. the percentage increase in loans originated was lower than the percentage increase in the number of homes closed due to a decrease in our mortgage capture rate to 56% in fiscal 2013, from 59% in fiscal 2012. home loans to customers of our homebuilding operations constituted 86% of dhi mortgage loan originations in 2013, compared to 84% in 2012.
the number of loans sold increased by 16% in 2013 compared to 2012, corresponding to the 17% increase in the number of loans originated. virtually all of the mortgage loans originated during fiscal 2013 and mortgage loans held for sale on september 30, 2013 were eligible for sale to fannie mae, freddie mac or ginnie mae. approximately 44% of the mortgage loans sold by dhi mortgage during fiscal 2013 were sold to one major financial institution.
financial services revenues and expenses revenues from the financial services segment increased 47%, to $173.4 million in fiscal 2013 from $117.8 million in fiscal 2012. the volume of loans sold increased 16% while revenues from the sale of servicing rights and gains from sale of mortgages increased 52%. loan sale revenue increased at a higher rate than loan sale volume primarily due to a more competitive marketplace among loan purchasers, resulting in an improved execution in the secondary market, as well as an increase in the average loan amount due to an increase in the sales prices of homes closed by our homebuilding operations. loan origination fees increased 13%, corresponding to increases in the number of loans originated of 17%. charges related to recourse obligations were $0.5 million in fiscal 2013, compared to $4.7 million in fiscal 2012.
income before income taxes pre-tax income for fiscal 2013 was $657.8 million, compared to $242.9 million for fiscal 2012. the difference in our operating results for 2013 compared to 2012 was due to higher revenues from increased home closings and sales of mortgage loans and higher profit margins in both our homebuilding and financial services businesses.
income taxes our income tax expense in fiscal 2013 was $195.1 million, compared to a benefit of $713.4 million in 2012. the effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 was 29.7%. we did not have a meaningful effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 because our net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance until the third quarter of fiscal 2012 when we significantly reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
at september 30, 2013 and 2012, we had deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, of $617.6 million and $751.4 million, respectively, offset by valuation allowances of $31.0 million and $41.9 million, respectively. at september 30, 2013, we had tax benefits of $99.3 million for state nol carryforwards that expire (beginning at various times depending on the tax jurisdiction) from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2032. we also had state tax credit carryforwards of $4.0 million that expire from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2023 and $1.9 million of state tax credit carryforwards had no expiration date.
when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods. we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. in fiscal 2012, we determined it was more likely than not that the substantial majority of our deferred tax assets would be realized, which resulted in a $753.2 million reversal of all of the valuation allowance related to our federal deferred tax assets and a portion of the valuation allowance related to our state deferred tax assets.
further changes in the valuation allowance were recorded during fiscal 2013 based on our quarterly evaluations to determine the need for a valuation allowance related to our state deferred tax assets. at march 31, 2013, after considering the impact of significantly improving profits from operations, we concluded it was more likely than not that we would realize more of our deferred tax assets related to state nol carryforwards than previously anticipated. we based this conclusion on additional positive evidence related to the actual pre-tax profits achieved during the six months ended march 31, 2013 and higher levels of forecasted profitability for the remainder of fiscal 2013 and in future years. we expected these increased profits to result in a greater realization of our nol carryforwards in certain states before they expire than previously estimated. accordingly, at march 31, 2013, we reduced the valuation allowance on our state deferred tax assets by $18.7 million to a balance of $23.2 million. because this reduction of the valuation allowance was recognized in an interim period, a portion of the valuation allowance to be reversed was allocated to the remaining interim periods. therefore, we reversed an additional $2.9 million of the valuation allowance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2013. additionally, approximately $13.2 million of our valuation allowance was attributable to state nol carryforwards that expired at the end of fiscal 2013, at which time the related unrealized deferred tax assets and valuation allowances were written off. the amount of our valuation allowance at september 30, 2013 as a result of the activity described above would have been $7.1 million.
at september 30, 2013 we recorded an out-of-period adjustment which increased both our deferred income taxes and the valuation allowance on our deferred income taxes by $23.9 million. the out-of-period adjustment had no impact on our statement of operations during fiscal 2013. the increase in our deferred income taxes of $23.9 million corrected an error in recording the future benefits for state nol carryforwards based on each of our legal entities' nols in each state and the current tax rate of each state. the valuation allowance was also increased by $23.9 million because we determined it was more likely than not that these state nol carryforwards would not be realized because we estimated that we would not have sufficient taxable income within these states' carryforward periods. as a result of this adjustment, the remaining amount of the valuation allowance related to state deferred tax assets was $31.0 million at september 30, 2013. our valuation allowance was based on an analysis of the amount of nol carryforwards associated with each of our legal entities in the states in which we conduct business, as compared to our expected level of taxable income under existing apportionment or recognition rules in each state and the carryforward periods allowed in each state's tax code. had deferred income taxes related to the state nol carryforwards of each of our legal entities been reflected at state specific tax rates as of september 30, 2012, our deferred income taxes would have increased by $31.6 million and the corresponding valuation allowance on our deferred income taxes would have increased by $37.6 million. this would have resulted in a decrease in our income tax benefit of $6.0 million in fiscal 2012, which would have reversed and decreased our income tax expense by $6.0 million in fiscal 2013. the unadjusted amounts from fiscal 2012 were not material to our financial statements for fiscal 2012, and the out-of-period adjustment recorded in fiscal 2013 was not material to our financial statements for fiscal 2013.
at september 30, 2013 and 2012, the total amount of our unrecognized tax benefits was $4.2 million and $14.1 million, respectively. during fiscal 2013 and 2012, we recognized interest benefits related to unrecognized tax benefits of $2.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations. at september 30, 2013 and 2012, our total accrued interest expense relating to unrecognized tax benefits was $2.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and there were no accrued penalties.
the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law on january 2, 2013, and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
capital resources and liquidity we have historically funded our homebuilding and financial services operations with cash flows from operating activities, borrowings under bank credit facilities and the issuance of new debt securities. our current levels of cash, borrowing capacity and balance sheet leverage provide us with the operational flexibility to adjust to homebuilding market conditions. during the last two years, we have increased our investments in homes, finished lots, land and land development to expand our operations and grow our profitability. we intend to maintain adequate liquidity and balance sheet strength, and we regularly evaluate opportunities to access the capital markets.
at september 30, 2014, our ratio of homebuilding debt to total capital was 39.4%, compared to 44.6% at september 30, 2013. our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital (homebuilding notes payable net of cash divided by homebuilding notes payable net of cash plus total equity) was 34.5% at september 30, 2014, compared to 36.3% at september 30, 2013. the improvement in these ratios is primarily due to the conversion of our 2% convertible senior notes into equity during the current fiscal year, which decreased our homebuilding debt and increased our total capital. we intend to maintain our ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital within or below a range of 40% to 45% over the long term, but we may choose to operate above this range for short-term periods. therefore, future net homebuilding debt to total capital ratios may be higher than the current level.
we believe that the ratio of net homebuilding debt to total capital is useful in understanding the leverage employed in our homebuilding operations and comparing our capital structure with other homebuilders. because of its capital function, we include our homebuilding cash as a reduction of our homebuilding debt and total capital. we exclude the debt of our financial services business because it is separately capitalized and its obligation under its repurchase agreement is substantially collateralized and not guaranteed by our parent company or any of our homebuilding entities.
we believe that our existing cash resources, our revolving credit facility and our mortgage repurchase facility provide sufficient liquidity to fund our near-term working capital needs and debt obligations. we regularly assess our projected capital requirements to fund future growth in our business, repay our future debt obligations, and support our other general corporate and operational needs, and we regularly evaluate our opportunities to raise additional capital. we have an automatically effective universal shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september 2012, registering debt and equity securities which we may issue from time to time in amounts to be determined. as market conditions permit, we may issue new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets or obtain additional bank financing to fund our projected capital requirements or provide additional liquidity.
homebuilding capital resources cash and cash equivalents - at september 30, 2014, our homebuilding cash and cash equivalents were $632.5 million.
bank credit facility - we have a senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was amended in august 2014 to increase its capacity from $725 million to $975 million and to extend its maturity date to september 7, 2019. the facility has an uncommitted accordion feature that could increase the size of the facility to $1.25 billion, subject to certain conditions and availability of additional bank commitments. the facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sublimit equal to approximately 50% of the revolving credit commitment. letters of credit issued under the facility reduce the available borrowing capacity. the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be based on either the prime rate or london interbank offered rate (libor) plus an applicable margin, as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility. at september 30, 2014, we had $300.0 million of borrowings outstanding at a 2.9% annual interest rate and $92.7 million of letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility, resulting in available capacity of $582.3 million.
our revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on our operations and activities, including requiring the maintenance of a minimum level of tangible net worth, a maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and a borrowing base restriction if our ratio of debt to tangible net worth exceeds a certain level. these covenants are measured as defined in the credit agreement governing the facility and are reported to the lenders quarterly. a failure to comply with these financial covenants could allow the lending banks to terminate the availability of funds under the revolving credit facility or cause any outstanding borrowings to become due and payable prior to maturity. in addition, the credit agreement governing the facility imposes restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. at september 30, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the covenants, limitations and restrictions of our revolving credit facility.
secured letter of credit agreements - we have secured letter of credit agreements which require us to deposit cash, in an amount approximating the balance of letters of credit outstanding, as collateral with the issuing banks. the amount of cash restricted for letters of credit issued under these agreements totaled $3.1 million and $8.5 million at september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and is included in homebuilding restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets.
public unsecured debt - on january 15, 2014, we repaid the remaining $145.9 million principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes which were due on that date. on september 15, 2014, we repaid the remaining $137.9 million principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes which were due on that date. in february 2014, we issued $500 million principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due march 1, 2019, with interest payable semi-annually. the annual effective interest rate of the senior notes after giving effect to the amortization of financing costs is 3.9%. we have $157.7 million principal amount of our senior notes maturing before the end of fiscal 2015. the indentures governing our senior notes impose restrictions on the creation of secured debt and liens. at september 30, 2014, we were in compliance with all of the limitations and restrictions that form a part of the public debt obligations.
debt and equity repurchase authorizations - effective august 1, 2014, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of debt securities and $100 million of our common stock effective through july 31, 2015. the full amount of each of these authorizations was remaining at september 30, 2014.
financial services capital resources cash and cash equivalents - at september 30, 2014, our financial services cash and cash equivalents were $29.3 million.
mortgage repurchase facility - our mortgage subsidiary, dhi mortgage, has a mortgage repurchase facility that is accounted for as a secured financing. the mortgage repurchase facility provides financing and liquidity to dhi mortgage by facilitating purchase transactions in which dhi mortgage transfers eligible loans to the counterparties against the transfer of funds by the counterparties, thereby becoming purchased loans. dhi mortgage then has the right and obligation to repurchase the purchased loans upon their sale to third-party purchasers in the secondary market or within specified time frames from 45 to 120 days in accordance with the terms of the mortgage repurchase facility. the total capacity of the facility is $300 million; however, the capacity can be increased up to $400 million subject to the availability of additional commitments. in february 2014, the mortgage repurchase facility was renewed and amended. this renewal and amendment extends the maturity date of the facility to february 27, 2015 and allows for the capacity of the facility to be increased, without requiring additional commitments, from $300 million to $325 million on the last five days of any fiscal quarter and the first twenty-five days of the following fiscal quarter, excluding the quarter ending december 31, 2014. through an additional commitment obtained in september 2014, the capacity of the facility was temporarily increased to $400 million until october 24, 2014.
as of september 30, 2014, $448.1 million of mortgage loans held for sale with a collateral value of $429.0 million were pledged under the mortgage repurchase facility. as a result of advance paydowns totaling $69.8 million, dhi mortgage had an obligation of $359.2 million outstanding under the mortgage repurchase facility at september 30, 2014 at a 2.6% annual interest rate.
the mortgage repurchase facility is not guaranteed by d.r. horton, inc. or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt. the facility contains financial covenants as to the mortgage subsidiary's minimum required tangible net worth, its maximum allowable ratio of debt to tangible net worth and its minimum required liquidity. these covenants are measured and reported monthly. at september 30, 2014, dhi mortgage was in compliance with all of the conditions and covenants of the mortgage repurchase facility.
in the past, our mortgage subsidiary has been able to renew or extend its mortgage credit facility on satisfactory terms prior to its maturity, and obtain temporary additional commitments through amendments to the credit agreement during periods of higher than normal volumes of mortgages held for sale. the liquidity of our financial services business depends upon its continued ability to renew and extend the mortgage repurchase facility or to obtain other additional financing in sufficient capacities.
operating cash flow activities in fiscal 2014, we used $661.4 million of cash in our operating activities, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013. we used $918.2 million of cash to increase our construction in progress and finished home inventory, compared to $815.3 million in fiscal 2013. we used $513.6 million of cash to increase our residential land and lot inventory through purchases of land and finished lots and increased land development activity, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013. cash used for operations in the prior year reflected our significant inventory investments as we responded to improved market conditions. we slowed the growth of our land and lot inventories in fiscal 2014 to align with our desired level of owned land and lots, while increasing our homes in inventory to capture an increased share of new home demand.
investing cash flow activities in fiscal 2014, net cash used in investing activities was $282.1 million, compared to $180.9 million provided by investing activities in fiscal 2013. the primary use of cash for investing activities during fiscal 2014 was related to the acquisition of the homebuilding operations of crown communities for $209.6 million in cash. we also purchased the homebuilding operations of regent homes for $34.5 million.
we used $100.2 million and $58.0 million in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, to purchase property and equipment, including model home furniture, office and technology equipment and office buildings to support our operations. the purchases of property and equipment during fiscal 2014 included the purchase of 177,000 acres in new mexico as a long-term land investment for $56.0 million, of which $37.4 million was paid in cash and $18.6 million was notes payable assumed from the seller. of the total purchase price, $46.5 million was allocated to land and the remainder was allocated to buildings, improvements and equipment. as part of the purchase, we also obtained the livestock grazing rights under long-term leases on approximately 114,000 acres of land. we plan to use the property to conduct ranching and agricultural activities.
cash provided by investing activities during fiscal 2014 included a $67.8 million decrease in restricted cash due to a reduction in the amount of letters of credit that were cash collateralized in fiscal 2014, compared to an increase of $28.5 million in restricted cash due to an increase in the amount of cash collateralized on letters of credit in fiscal 2013.
in fiscal 2013, the primary source of investing cash flows was the receipt of proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities, which totaled $296.5 million, net of purchases. additionally, during fiscal 2013 we paid $18.6 million to purchase defaulted debt securities collateralized by one residential real estate parcel and we paid $9.4 million to complete our purchase of the homebuilding operations of breland homes, acquired in august 2012.
financing cash flow activities we expect the short-term financing needs of our operations will be funded with existing cash, cash generated from profits and borrowings available under our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities. long-term financing needs for the growth of our operations have historically been funded with the issuance of senior unsecured debt securities through the public capital markets.
in fiscal 2014, net cash provided by financing activities was $627.9 million, consisting primarily of note proceeds, partially offset by repayments of notes payable and payments of cash dividends. proceeds from notes payable of $1.4 billion included our issuance of $500 million principal amount of 3.75% senior notes in february 2014, borrowings of $810.0 million on the revolving credit facility and borrowings of $120.6 million under our mortgage repurchase facility. note repayments of $796.9 million included our repayment of $145.9 million principal amount of our 6.125% senior notes and $137.9 million principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes at maturity, and our repayment of $510.0 million drawn on the revolving credit facility. during fiscal 2013, financing activities provided $939.0 million of cash, primarily from our issuance of a total of $1.1 billion principal amount of senior notes, borrowings of $165.0 million on the revolving credit facility and borrowings of $50.8 million under our mortgage repurchase facility. note repayments of $345.1 million in fiscal 2013 included our repayment of$171.7 million principal amount of our 6.875% senior notes at maturity and repayment of the $165.0 million drawn on the revolving credit facility.
during the first quarter of fiscal 2013, the board of directors approved and paid total cash dividends of $0.1875 per common share, which included cash dividends of $0.0375 per share and an additional cash dividend of $0.15 per share. the cash dividend of $0.15 per share was in lieu of and accelerated the payment of all quarterly dividends that would have otherwise been paid in calendar year 2013.
the declaration of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, cash flows, capital requirements, our financial condition and general business conditions.
contractual cash obligations, commercial commitments and off-balance sheet arrangements our primary contractual cash obligations for our homebuilding and financial services segments are payments under our debt agreements and lease payments under operating leases. we expect to fund our contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business through a combination of our existing cash resources, cash flows generated from profits, our homebuilding and financial services credit facilities or other bank financing, and the issuance of new debt or equity securities through the public capital markets as market conditions may permit.
(1)   homebuilding notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our senior notes, our revolving credit facility and our secured notes. the principal amount of our revolving credit facility is assumed to be $300 million through its maturity, and the related interest obligation is based on the effective rate of 2.9% as of september 30, 2014.
(2)   financial services notes payable represent principal and interest payments due on our mortgage subsidiary's repurchase facility. the interest obligation associated with this variable rate facility is based on its annual effective rate of 2.6% and principal balance outstanding at september 30, 2014.
at september 30, 2014, our homebuilding operations had outstanding letters of credit of $95.8 million, of which $3.1 million were cash collateralized, and surety bonds of $876.2 million, issued by third parties to secure performance under various contracts. we expect that our performance obligations secured by these letters of credit and bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms. when we complete our performance obligations, the related letters of credit and bonds are generally released shortly thereafter, leaving us with no continuing obligations. we have no material third-party guarantees.
our mortgage subsidiary enters into various commitments related to the lending activities of our mortgage operations. further discussion of these commitments is provided in item 7a "quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk" under part ii of this annual report on form 10-k.
we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts to acquire land or lots for the construction of homes. lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with limited capital investment and substantially reduce the risks associated with land ownership and development. among our land and lot option purchase contracts at september 30, 2014, there were a limited number of contracts, representing $30.9 million of remaining purchase price, subject to specific performance clauses which may require us to purchase the land or lots upon the land sellers meeting their contractual obligations. further information about our land option contracts is provided in the "inventories, land and lot position and homes in inventory" section included herein.
seasonality although significant changes in market conditions have impacted our seasonal patterns in the past and could do so again in the future, we generally have more homes under construction, close more homes and have greater revenues and operating income in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. the seasonal activity increases our working capital requirements for our homebuilding operations during our third and fourth fiscal quarters and increases our funding requirements for the mortgages we originate in our financial services segment at the end of these quarters. as a result of seasonal activity, our quarterly results of operations and financial position at the end of a particular fiscal quarter are not necessarily representative of the balance of our fiscal year.
inflation we may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation, primarily because of higher land, financing, labor and material construction costs. in addition, higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers. we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices. however, during periods when housing market conditions are challenging, we may not be able to offset our cost increases with higher selling prices.

critical accounting policies general - a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of d.r. horton, inc. and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september 30, 2014 and 2013, and for the years ended september 30, 2014, 2013 and 2012. each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap, we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business, the results of our operations and our financial condition, and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements. the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected.
revenue recognition - we generally recognize homebuilding revenue and related profit at the time of the closing of a sale, when title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer. in situations where the buyer's financing is originated by dhi mortgage, our 100% owned mortgage subsidiary, and the buyer has not made an adequate initial or continuing investment, the profit is deferred until the sale of the related mortgage loan to a third-party purchaser has been completed. any profit on land sales is deferred until the full accrual method criteria are met. when appropriate, revenue and profit on long-term construction projects are recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.
we include proceeds from home closings held for our benefit at title companies in homebuilding cash. when we execute sales contracts with our homebuyers, or when we require advance payment from homebuyers for custom changes, upgrades or options related to their homes, we record the cash deposits received as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled. we either retain or refund to the homebuyer deposits on canceled sales contracts, depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract or other circumstances.
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued, both of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed. we transfer substantially all underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies to third-party insurers. we typically elect the fair value option for our mortgage loan originations. mortgage loans held for sale are initially recorded at fair value based on either sale commitments or current market quotes and are adjusted for subsequent changes in fair value until the loans are sold. net origination costs and fees associated with mortgage loans are recognized at the time of origination. the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of a loan are included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings at the time of commitment. we generally sell the mortgages we originate and the related servicing rights to third-party purchasers. interest income is earned from the date a mortgage loan is originated until the loan is sold.
some mortgage loans are sold with limited recourse provisions, which can result in repurchases of loans previously sold to investors or payments to reimburse investors for loan losses. based on historical experience, discussions with our mortgage purchasers, analysis of the mortgages we originated and current housing and credit market conditions, we estimate and record a loss reserve for mortgage loans held in portfolio and mortgage loans held for sale, as well as known and projected mortgage loan repurchase requests. a 40% increase in the amount of expected mortgage loan repurchases and expected losses on mortgage loan repurchases would not result in a material change in our reserve for expected mortgage loan repurchases.
inventories and cost of sales - inventory includes the costs of direct land acquisition, land development and home construction, capitalized interest, real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction. costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete, such as utilities, maintenance, and cleaning, are charged to sg&a expense as incurred. all indirect overhead costs, such as compensation of sales personnel, division and region management, and the costs of advertising and builder's risk insurance are charged to sg&a expense as incurred.
land and development costs are typically allocated to individual residential lots on a pro-rata basis, and the costs of residential lots are transferred to construction in progress when home construction begins. we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating home construction costs. cost of sales for homes closed includes the specific construction costs of each home and all applicable land acquisition, land development and related costs (both incurred and estimated to be incurred) allocated to each residential lot based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community. any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a community are generally allocated on a pro-rata basis to the remaining homes in the community associated with the relevant development activity.
when a home is closed, we generally have not paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home. we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed. we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to determine the additional costs remaining to be paid on each closed home. we monitor the accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amounts previously accrued. although actual costs to be paid in the future on previously closed homes could differ from our current accruals, such differences have not been significant.
each quarter, the performance and outlook of land inventory and communities under development are reviewed for indicators of potential impairment. we generally review our inventory for impairment indicators at the community level, and the inventory within each community is categorized as land held for development, residential land and lots developed and under development, land held for sale and construction in progress and finished homes, based on the stage of production or plans for future development or sale. a particular community often includes inventory in more than one category. in certain situations, inventory may be analyzed separately for impairment purposes based on its product type (e.g. single family homes evaluated separately from condominium parcels). in reviewing each of our communities, we determine if impairment indicators exist on inventory held and used by analyzing a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the following:
•   projected gross margins based on community budgets;
•   performance of other communities in nearby locations.
if indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an impairment evaluation of the community, which includes an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are recorded to cost of sales if the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts. these estimates of cash flows are significantly impacted by community specific factors including estimates of the amounts and timing of future revenues and estimates of the amount of land development, materials and labor costs which, in turn, may be impacted by the following local market conditions:
•   supply and availability of new and existing homes;
•   location and desirability of our communities;
•   pricing and use of incentives by us and our competitors;
•   alternative uses for our land or communities such as the sale of land, finished lots or home sites to third parties;
for those assets deemed to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams. when an impairment charge for a community is determined, the charge is then allocated to each lot in the community in the same manner as land and development costs are allocated to each lot. impairment charges are also recorded on finished homes in substantially completed communities when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values are greater than the fair values less estimated costs to sell these homes.
for the inventory impairment analyses we performed during fiscal 2014, we assumed that for the majority of communities, sales prices in future periods will be equal to or lower than current sales order prices in each community, or in comparable communities, in order to generate an acceptable absorption rate. the remaining lives of the communities evaluated were estimated to be in a range from six months to ten years, and we utilized a range of discount rates for communities from 12% to 18%.
we rarely purchase land for resale. however, when we own land or communities under development that do not fit into our development and construction plans and determine we will sell the asset, the project is accounted for as land held for sale. we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. in performing the impairment evaluation for land held for sale, we consider several factors including, but not limited to, recent offers received to purchase the property, prices for land in recent comparable sales transactions and market analysis studies, which include the estimated price a willing buyer would pay for the land. if the estimated fair value less costs to sell an asset is less than the current carrying value, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell.
the key assumptions relating to inventory valuations are impacted by local market economic conditions and the actions of competitors, and are inherently uncertain. although our quarterly assessments reflect management's best estimates, due to uncertainties in the estimation process, actual results could differ from such estimates.
business acquisitions - we account for acquisitions of businesses by allocating the purchase price of the business to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values. any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. while we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.
goodwill - we record goodwill associated with our acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price of the business exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. we evaluate our goodwill balances for potential impairment on an annual basis. the accounting guidance allows an entity to assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform step one of a prescribed two-step annual goodwill impairment test. if an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. we performed a qualitative assessment of our goodwill balance of $94.8 million and $38.9 million at september 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and determined that the two-step process was not necessary.
warranty claims - we typically provide our homebuyers with a ten-year limited warranty for major defects in structural elements such as framing components and foundation systems, a two-year limited warranty on major mechanical systems, and a one-year limited warranty on other construction components. since we subcontract our construction work to subcontractors who typically provide an indemnity and a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, claims relating to workmanship and materials are generally the primary responsibility of the subcontractors. warranty liabilities have been established by charging cost of sales for each home delivered. the amounts charged are based on management's estimate of expected warranty-related costs under all unexpired warranty obligation periods. our warranty liability is based upon historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we
operate, and is adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the types of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them. actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts. a 10% change in the historical warranty rates used to estimate our warranty accrual would not result in a material change in our accrual.
our reserves for construction defect claims include the estimated costs of both known claims and anticipated future claims. as of september 30, 2014 and 2013, we had reserves for approximately 180 and 160 pending construction defect claims, respectively, and no individual existing claim was material to our financial statements. during fiscal 2014, we established reserves for approximately 80 new construction defect claims and resolved 60 construction defect claims for a total cost of $33.7 million. the majority of our total construction defect reserves consists of the estimated exposure to future claims on previously closed homes. we have closed a significant number of homes during recent years, and we may be subject to future construction defect claims on these homes. although regulations vary from state to state, construction defect issues can generally be reported for up to ten years after the home has closed in many states in which we operate. historical data and trends regarding the frequency of claims incurred and the costs to resolve claims relative to the types of products and markets where we operate are used to estimate the construction defect liabilities for both existing and anticipated future claims. these estimates are subject to ongoing revision as the circumstances of individual pending claims and historical data and trends change. adjustments to estimated reserves are recorded in the accounting period in which the change in estimate occurs.
historical trends in construction defect claims have been inconsistent, and we believe they may continue to fluctuate over the next several years. housing market conditions have been volatile across most of our markets over the past ten years, and we believe such conditions can affect the frequency and cost of construction defect claims. we closed a significant number of homes during our peak operating years from 2003 to 2007. if the ultimate resolution of construction defect claims resulting from closings in those years varies from current expectations, it could significantly change our estimates regarding the frequency and timing of claims incurred and the costs to resolve existing and anticipated future claims, which would impact the construction defect reserves in the future. if the frequency of claims incurred or costs of existing and future legal claims significantly exceed our current estimates, they will have a significant negative impact on our future earnings and liquidity.
we estimate and record receivables under applicable insurance policies related to our estimated contingencies for known claims and anticipated future construction defect claims on previously closed homes and other legal claims and lawsuits incurred in the ordinary course of business when recovery is probable. additionally, we may have the ability to recover a portion of our losses from our subcontractors and their insurance carriers when we have been named as an additional insured on their insurance policies.
the estimation of losses related to these reserves and the related estimates of recoveries from insurance policies are subject to a high degree of variability due to uncertainties such as trends in construction defect claims relative to our markets and the types of products built, claim frequency, claim settlement costs and patterns, insurance industry practices and legal interpretations, among others. due to the high degree of judgment required in establishing reserves for these contingencies, actual future costs and recoveries from insurance could differ significantly from current estimated amounts. a 10% increase in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim used to estimate the reserves would result in an increase of approximately $96.5 million in our reserves and a $51.7 million increase in our receivable, resulting in additional expense of $44.8 million. a 10% decrease in the claim frequency and the average cost per claim would result in a decrease of approximately $76.7 million in our reserves and a $38.1 million decrease in our receivable, resulting in a reduction in expense of $38.6 million.
income taxes - we calculate our income tax expense (benefit) using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, and of tax loss and credit carryforwards. in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future periods and in the jurisdictions in which those temporary differences become deductible. we record a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. in determining the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns, judgment is required. differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. changes in existing tax laws and tax rates also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time.
interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense. significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions. we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. our evaluations are based upon a number of factors, including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues. changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change.
stock-based compensation - our common stockholders formally authorize shares of stock-based compensation available for future grants. from time to time, the compensation committee of our board of directors authorizes the grant of stock-based compensation to our employees and directors from these available shares. at september 30, 2014, our outstanding stock-based compensation awards include stock options and restricted stock units. grants of restricted stock units may vest immediately or over a certain number of years as determined by the compensation committee of our board of directors. restricted stock units outstanding at september 30, 2014 have a remaining vesting period of 1 to 3 years. stock options are granted at exercise prices which equal the market value of our common stock at the date of the grant. the stock options outstanding at september 30, 2014 vest over periods of 2 to 9.75 years from the initial grant date and expire 10 years after the dates on which they were granted.
the compensation expense for stock-based awards is based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period. the fair values of restricted stock units are based on the stock prices at the date of grant. the fair values of stock options granted are calculated on the date of grant using a black-scholes option pricing model. determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. these variables include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and expected stock option exercise behavior. in addition, we also use judgment in estimating the number of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing cash flow.
fair value measurements - the fasb's authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy based upon the inputs to the valuation model of an asset or liability. the fair value hierarchy and its application to our assets and liabilities, is as follows:
•   level 1 - valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
•   level 2 - valuation is determined from quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, or by model-based techniques in which all significant inputs are observable in the market.
•   level 3 - valuation is typically derived from model-based techniques in which at least one significant input is unobservable and based on our own estimates about the assumptions that market participants would use to value the asset or liability.
when available, we use quoted market prices in active markets to determine fair value. we consider the principal market and nonperformance risk associated with our counterparties when determining the fair value measurements, if applicable. fair value measurements are used for our mortgage loans held for sale, debt securities collateralized by residential real estate, interest rate lock commitments (irlcs) and other derivative instruments on a recurring basis, and are used for inventories, other mortgage loans, rental properties and real estate owned on a nonrecurring basis, when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.

in june 2014, the fasb issued asu 2014-11, "transfers and servicing - repurchase-to-maturity transactions, repurchase financings, and disclosures," which changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions to secured borrowing accounting. also, for repurchase financing arrangements, the amendments require separate accounting for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with the same counterparty, which will result in secured borrowing accounting for the repurchase agreement. the guidance is effective for us beginning january 1, 2015 and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

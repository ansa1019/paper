item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview eog resources, inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively, eog), is one of the largest independent (non-integrated) crude oil and natural gas companies in the united states with proved reserves in the united states, canada, trinidad, the united kingdom and china.  eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries.  this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost-effective basis, allowing eog to deliver long-term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet.  eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low-cost reserves.  maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eog's strategy.
united states and canada.  eog's efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential have proven to be successful.  eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays, which in the aggregate have contributed substantially to, and are expected to continue to contribute substantially to, eog's crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas production.  eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise to unconventional crude oil and liquids-rich reservoirs.  in 2014, eog remained focused on developing its existing north american crude oil and liquids-rich acreage.  in addition, increasing drilling and completion efficiencies and testing methods to improve the recovery factor of oil-in-place remained areas of emphasis in 2014.  eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and liquids-rich natural gas exploration and development prospects.  on a volumetric basis, as calculated using the ratio of 1.0 barrel of crude oil and condensate or ngl to 6.0 thousand cubic feet of natural gas, crude oil and condensate and ngl production accounted for approximately 69% of total north american production during 2014 compared to 63% in 2013.  this liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the south texas eagle ford, the north dakota bakken and the permian basin.  in 2014, eog's net eagle ford production averaged 202.7 thousand barrels per day (mbbld) of crude oil and condensate and ngl as compared to 140.9 mbbld in 2013.  eog's major producing areas are in new mexico, north dakota, texas, utah and wyoming.
eog continues to deliver its crude oil to various markets in the united states, including sales points on the gulf coast where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet crude oil index.  eog's crude-by-rail facilities provide eog the flexibility to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets, including the gulf coast, cushing, oklahoma, and other markets.
during the fourth quarter of 2014, eog completed the divestiture of all its assets in manitoba, canada and the majority of its assets in alberta, canada in two separate transactions.  proceeds from the divestitures were approximately 400 million united states dollars, net of customary transaction adjustments. as a result of these transactions, approximately 150 million united states dollars of restricted cash related to future abandonment liabilities was released. the proceeds and cash were utilized for general corporate purposes.  production from the divested assets totaled approximately 7,050 barrels of crude oil per day, 580 barrels of ngl per day and 43.5 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. net proved reserves divested are estimated to be 7.7 million barrels of oil, 0.8 million barrels of ngl and 78.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. eog divested 1.3 million gross acres (1.1 million net acres), 97 percent of which were in alberta, and approximately 5,800 producing wells of which 5,155 were natural gas. eog reclassified approximately $383 million of accumulated translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income as the divestitures represented a substantially complete liquidation of eog's canadian operations. see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.
international. in trinidad, eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts. several fields in the south east coast consortium (secc) block, modified u(a) block, block 4(a) and modified u(b) block and the emz area have been developed and are producing natural gas which is sold to the national gas company of trinidad and tobago and its subsidiary and crude oil and condensate which is sold to the petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited. in the fourth quarter of
2014, eog initiated a three-net well drilling program in the secc and modified u(b) blocks, completing one well in 2014. in 2015, eog expects to drill and complete the remaining two net wells in this program.
in the united kingdom, eog continues to make progress in the development of its 100% working interest east irish sea conwy crude oil discovery. modifications to the nearby third-party owned douglas platform, which will be used to process conwy production, began in 2013 and continued throughout 2014. first production from the conwy field is anticipated in the third quarter of 2015. in the fourth quarter of 2014, eog recognized a $351 million impairment of the conwy project as a result of crude oil price declines.
in the sichuan basin, sichuan province, china, in 2014, eog drilled two wells and completed two wells, one of which was originally drilled in 2013. in 2015, eog expects to complete the second well that was drilled in 2014 and drill and complete four additional wells.
eog's activity in argentina is focused on the vaca muerta oil shale formation in the neuquén basin in neuquén province. in 2014, eog completed a vertical well in the cerro avispa block that was drilled in late 2013 and determined the well to be a dry hole. also during 2014, eog participated in the drilling of two wells in the bajo del toro block, both of which were determined to be dry holes. in the fourth quarter of 2014, eog recognized an impairment charge of $44 million for the balance of its investment in argentina. management is currently evaluating options for its investment.
eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified.
capital structure one of management's key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt-to-total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog's peer group.  eog's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 25% at december 31, 2014 and 28% at december 31, 2013.  as used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity. at december 31, 2014, $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.95% senior notes due 2015 were reclassified as long-term debt based upon eog's intent and ability to ultimately replace such amount with other long-term debt.
on march 21, 2014, eog closed its sale of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.45% senior notes due 2020 (notes). interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on april 1 and october 1 of each year, beginning october 1, 2014. net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately $496 million were used for general corporate purposes.
on march 17, 2014, eog repaid upon maturity the $150 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.75% subsidiary debt due 2014 (subsidiary debt) and settled the foreign currency swap entered into contemporaneously with the issuance of the subsidiary debt for $32 million.
on february 3, 2014, eog repaid upon maturity the $350 million aggregate principal amount of its floating rate senior notes due 2014 (floating rate notes). on the same date, eog settled the interest rate swap entered into contemporaneously with the issuance of the floating rate notes for $0.8 million.
during 2014, eog funded $8.4 billion in exploration and development and other property, plant and equipment expenditures (excluding asset retirement obligations), repaid at maturity $500 million aggregate principal amount of long-term debt, paid $280 million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased $127 million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans, primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities, net proceeds of $569 million from the sale of assets, net proceds from the sale of the notes and $99 million of excess tax benefits from stock compensation.
total anticipated 2015 capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion, excluding acquisitions. the majority of 2015 expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activities. eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement and equity and debt offerings.
when it fits eog's strategy, eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and/or production opportunities. management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog's history.
results of operations the following review of operations for each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2014, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of eog and notes thereto beginning on page f-1.
net operating revenues during 2014, net operating revenues increased $3,548 million, or 24%, to $18,035 million from $14,487 million in 2013. total wellhead revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of eog's production of crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas, increased $1,837 million, or 17%, to $12,593 million in 2014 from $10,756 million in 2013. revenues from the sales of crude oil and condensate and ngl in 2014 were approximately 85% of total wellhead revenues compared to 84% in 2013. during 2014, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million compared to net losses of $166 million in 2013. gathering, processing and marketing revenues, which are revenues generated from sales of third-party crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas as well as gathering fees associated with gathering third-party natural gas, increased $402 million during 2014, to $4,046 million from $3,644 million in 2013.  gains on asset dispositions, net, totaled $508 million and $198 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively.

(3)   dollars per barrel or per thousand cubic feet, as applicable. excludes the impact of financial commodity derivative instruments (see note 12 to consolidated financial statements).
2014 compared to 2013.  wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2014 increased $1,441 million, or 17%, to $9,742 million from $8,301 million in 2013, due to an increase of 68.5 mbbld, or 31%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,558 million), partially offset by a lower composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($1,117 million).  the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford, the north dakota bakken and the permian basin.  eog's composite wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2014 decreased 10% to $92.58 per barrel compared to $103.20 per barrel in 2013.
ngl revenues in 2014 increased $160 million, or 21%, to $934 million from $774 million in 2013, due to an increase of 15 mbbld, or 23%, in ngl deliveries ($179 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($19 million).  the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford and the permian basin.  eog's composite ngl price in 2014 decreased 2% to $31.91 per barrel compared to $32.55 per barrel in 2013.
wellhead natural gas revenues in 2014 increased $235 million, or 14%, to $1,916 million from $1,681 million in 2013, primarily due to a higher composite wellhead natural gas price.  eog's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 13% to $3.88 per mcf in 2014 compared to $3.42 per mcf in 2013.  natural gas deliveries in 2014 increased less than 1% to 1,353 mmcfd as compared to 1,347 mmcfd in 2013. increased production in the united states (12 mmcfd) and trinidad (8 mmcfd) was offset by lower production in canada (15 mmcfd). in the united states, increased production of associated natural gas in the eagle ford and permian basin areas was partially offset by lower production in the upper gulf coast and fort worth basin barnett shale areas.
during 2014, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $834 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $34 million. during 2013, eog recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of crude oil and natural gas financial derivative contracts of $116 million.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues were primarily related to sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas.  purchases and sales of third-party crude oil and natural gas are utilized in order to balance firm transportation capacity with production in certain areas and to utilize excess capacity at eog-owned facilities.  marketing costs represent the costs of purchasing third-party crude oil and natural gas and the associated transportation costs.
gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2014 declined $75 million compared to 2013, primarily due to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities.
2013 compared to 2012.  wellhead crude oil and condensate revenues in 2013 increased $2,642 million, or 47%, to $8,301 million from $5,659 million in 2012, due to an increase of 63 mbbld, or 40%, in wellhead crude oil and condensate deliveries ($2,205 million) and a higher composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price ($437 million).  the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased production in the eagle ford, the north dakota bakken and the permian basin.  eog's composite average wellhead crude oil and condensate price for 2013 increased 6% to $103.20 per barrel compared to $97.77 per barrel in 2012.
ngl revenues in 2013 increased $47 million, or 6%, to $774 million from $727 million in 2012, due to an increase of 9 mbbld, or 17%, in ngl deliveries ($118 million), partially offset by a lower composite average price ($71 million).  the increase in deliveries primarily reflects increased volumes in the eagle ford.  eog's composite average ngl price in 2013 decreased 8% to $32.55 per barrel compared to $35.54 per barrel in 2012.
wellhead natural gas revenues in 2013 increased $109 million, or 7%, to $1,681 million from $1,572 million in 2012.  the increase was due to a higher composite average wellhead natural gas price ($288 million), partially offset by decreased natural gas deliveries ($179 million).  eog's composite average wellhead natural gas price increased 21% to $3.42 per mcf in 2013 compared to $2.83 per mcf in 2012.  natural gas deliveries in 2013 decreased 169 mmcfd, or 11%, primarily due to decreased production in the united states (126 mmcfd), trinidad (23 mmcfd) and canada (19 mmcfd).  the decrease in the united states was attributable to asset sales and reduced natural gas drilling activity.  the decrease in trinidad was primarily attributable to higher contractual deliveries in 2012.
during 2013, eog recognized net losses on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $166 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $116 million.  during 2012, eog recognized net gains on the mark-to-market of financial commodity derivative contracts of $394 million, which included net cash received from settlements of commodity derivative contracts of $711 million.
during 2013, gathering, processing and marketing revenues and marketing costs increased, compared to 2012, primarily as a result of increased crude oil marketing activities.  gathering, processing and marketing revenues less marketing costs in 2013 decreased $66 million, compared to 2012, due primarily to lower margins on crude oil marketing activities.
the primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, dd&a, g&a and net interest expense for 2014 compared to 2013 are set forth below.  see "net operating revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes.
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient, safe and environmentally responsible operations.  eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas.  operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas, as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors, fluctuate over time.
lease and well expenses of $1,416 million in 2014 increased $310 million from $1,106 million in 2013 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance costs ($209 million), increased workover expenditures ($69 million) and increased lease and well administrative expenses ($32 million), all in the united states.
transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale.  transportation costs include transportation fees, costs associated with crude-by-rail operations, the cost of compression (the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements), dehydration (the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements), gathering fees and fuel costs.
dd&a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  eog's dd&a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual dd&a group calculations.  there are several factors that can impact eog's composite dd&a rate and expense, such as field production profiles, drilling or acquisition of new wells, disposition of existing wells and reserve revisions (upward or downward) primarily related to well performance, economic factors and
impairments.  changes to these factors may cause eog's composite dd&a rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period.  dd&a of the cost of other property, plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight-line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets.
dd&a expenses in 2014 increased $396 million to $3,997 million from $3,601 million in 2013.  dd&a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2014 were $384 million higher than in 2013 primarily due to increased production in the united states ($630 million), partially offset by lower unit rates in the united states ($191 million) and canada ($37 million) and a decrease in production in canada ($31 million).  unit rates in the united states decreased primarily due to upward reserve revisions and reserves added at lower costs as a result of increased efficiencies.
g&a expenses of $402 million in 2014 were $54 million higher than 2013 primarily due to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations.
net interest expense of $201 million in 2014 was $34 million lower than 2013 primarily due to repayment of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% senior notes due 2013, the subsidiary debt and the floating rate notes ($31 million), as well as an increase in capitalized interest across the company ($8 million). this was partially offset by interest expense on the notes issued in march 2014 ($10 million).
gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eog's gathering and processing assets.
gathering and processing costs increased $38 million to $146 million in 2014 compared to $108 million in 2013 primarily due to increased activities in the eagle ford.
exploration costs of $184 million in 2014 increased $23 million from $161 million in 2013 primarily due to increased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states.
impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs; as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets.  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired, eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a dd&a group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards board's accounting standards codification (asc).  in certain instances, eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value.
impairments of $744 million in 2014 increased $457 million from $287 million in 2013 primarily due to increased impairments of proved properties in the united kingdom ($351 million), the united states ($145 million) and argentina ($39 million); and increased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states ($54 million); partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties in canada ($67 million) and trinidad ($14 million); and lower impairments of other assets in the united states ($46 million). eog recorded impairments of proved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $575 million and $172 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. the 2014 and 2013 amounts include impairments of $503 million and $7 million, respectively, related to certain assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value.
taxes other than income in 2014 increased $134 million to $758 million (6.0% of wellhead revenues) from $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) in 2013.  the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increases in severance/production taxes ($112 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes ($34 million) in the united states, partially offset by an increase in credits available to eog in 2014 for texas high-cost gas severance tax rate reductions ($11 million).
income tax provision of $2,080 million in 2014 increased $840 million from $1,240 million in 2013 due primarily to higher pretax income.  the net effective tax rate for 2014 increased to 42% from 36% in the prior year. the net effective tax rate for 2014 exceeded the united states statutory tax rate (35%) due primarily to valuation allowances in the united kingdom and deferred tax in the united states related to eog's undistributed foreign earnings. eog no longer asserts that foreign earnings will remain permanently reinvested abroad and therefore recorded deferred tax of $250 million on the accumulated balance of such earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014.
the primary factors impacting the cost components of per-unit rates of lease and well, transportation costs, dd&a, g&a and net interest expense for 2013 compared to 2012 are set forth below.  see "net operating revenues" above for a discussion of production volumes.
lease and well expenses of $1,106 million in 2013 increased $106 million from $1,000 million in 2012 primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states ($48 million) and canada ($13 million) and increased workover expenditures in the united states ($38 million).
dd&a expenses in 2013 increased $431 million to $3,601 million from $3,170 million in 2012.  dd&a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in 2013 were $473 million higher than in 2012 primarily due to increased production in the united states ($347 million) and higher unit rates in the united states ($133 million) and trinidad ($44 million), partially offset by a decrease in production in canada ($29 million) and trinidad ($10 million) and lower unit rates in canada ($12 million).  dd&a unit rates in the united states increased due primarily to downward revisions of natural gas reserves at december 31, 2012, and a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties.
dd&a expenses associated with other property, plant and equipment were $42 million lower in 2013 than in 2012 primarily in the fort worth basin barnett shale area ($32 million), the eagle ford ($7 million) and the rocky mountain area ($7 million).
g&a expenses of $348 million in 2013 were $17 million higher than 2012 due primarily to higher costs associated with supporting expanding operations.
net interest expense of $235 million in 2013 was $22 million higher than 2012 due primarily to interest expense on the $1,250 million principal amount of 2.625% senior notes due 2023 issued in september 2012 ($23 million).  this was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the 6.125% senior notes, which were repaid at maturity in october 2013 ($6 million).
gathering and processing costs increased $10 million to $108 million in 2013 compared to $98 million in 2012.  the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the eagle ford ($22 million), partially offset by decreased costs in canada ($9 million).
exploration costs of $161 million in 2013 decreased $25 million from $186 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased geological and geophysical expenditures in the united states.
impairments of $287 million in 2013 decreased $984 million from $1,271 million in 2012 primarily due to decreased impairments of proved and unproved properties in canada ($881 million), decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states ($98 million) and decreased amortization of unproved property costs in the united states ($17 million).  eog recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties; other property, plant and equipment; and other assets of $172 million and $1,133 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  the 2013 and 2012 amounts include impairments of $7 million and $1,022 million, respectively, related to certain north american assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value.
taxes other than income in 2013 increased $129 million to $624 million (5.8% of wellhead revenues) from $495 million (6.2% of wellhead revenues) in 2012.  the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance/production taxes in the united states ($122 million) primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and higher ad valorem/property taxes in the united states ($15 million), partially offset by decreased severance/production taxes in canada ($9 million).
capital resources and liquidity cash flow the primary sources of cash for eog during the three-year period ended december 31, 2014, were funds generated from operations, proceeds from asset sales, net proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, net commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and revolving credit facilities.  the primary uses of cash were funds used in operations; exploration and development expenditures; other property, plant and equipment expenditures; repayments of debt; dividend payments to stockholders; and purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans.
2014 compared to 2013.  net cash provided by operating activities of $8,649 million in 2014 increased $1,320 million from $7,329 million in 2013 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($1,837 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($391 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for interest expense ($38 million), partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses ($662 million), an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($82 million) and an increase in net cash paid for income taxes ($48 million).
net cash used in investing activities of $7,514 million in 2014 increased by $1,199 million from $6,315 million in 2013 primarily due to an increase in additions to oil and gas properties ($823 million); an increase in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($364 million); and a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($191 million); partially offset by the release of restricted cash ($126 million) and favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($52 million).
net cash used in financing activities of $328 million during 2014 included repayments of long-term debt ($500 million), cash dividend payments ($280 million), purchases of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans ($127 million) and the settlement of a foreign currency swap ($32 million).  cash provided by financing activities in 2014 included net proceeds from the issuance of the notes ($496 million), excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($99 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($22 million).
2013 compared to 2012.  net cash provided by operating activities of $7,329 million in 2013 increased $2,092 million from $5,237 million in 2012 primarily reflecting an increase in wellhead revenues ($2,798 million), favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities ($405 million) and a decrease in net cash paid for income taxes ($65 million), partially offset by an unfavorable change in the net cash received from the settlement of financial commodity derivative contracts ($595 million), an increase in cash operating expenses ($478 million) and an increase in net cash paid for interest expense ($39 million).
net cash used in investing activities of $6,315 million in 2013 increased by $196 million from $6,119 million for the same period of 2012 due primarily to a decrease in proceeds from sales of assets ($549 million); and an increase in restricted cash ($66 million); partially offset by a decrease in additions to other property, plant and equipment ($256 million); favorable changes in working capital associated with investing activities ($125 million); and a decrease in additions to oil and gas properties ($38 million).
net cash used in financing activities of $574 million during 2013 included the repayment of long-term debt ($400 million), cash dividend payments ($199 million) and treasury stock purchases in connection with stock compensation plans ($64 million).  cash provided by financing activities in 2013 included excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation ($56 million) and proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity ($39 million).
total expenditures the table below sets out components of total expenditures for the years ended december 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):
expenditure category capital drilling and facilities                             $6,910              $6,044              $6,184
leasehold acquisitions (1)                             370                 414                 505
property acquisitions                                  139                 120                   1
capitalized interest                                    57                  49                  50
exploration and development expenditures             7,709               6,863               6,941
total exploration and development expenditures       7,905               6,997               7,068
total expenditures                                  $8,632              $7,361              $7,754
(1)   leasehold acquisitions included $5 million in both 2014 and 2013 and $20 million in 2012 related to non-cash property exchanges.
(2)   in 2012, other property, plant and equipment included non-cash additions of $66 million in connection with a capital lease transaction in the eagle ford.
exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million for 2014 were $846 million higher than the prior year primarily due to increased drilling and facilities expenditures in the united states ($1,019 million) and china ($12 million); and increased property acquisitions ($19 million), increased exploration geological and geophysical expenditures ($18 million), and increased capitalized interest ($8 million), all in the united states.  these increases were partially offset by decreased drilling and facilities expenditures in canada ($82 million), trinidad ($57 million), the united kingdom ($40 million) and argentina ($14 million); and decreased leasehold acquisition expenditures in the united states ($46 million).  the 2014 exploration and development expenditures of $7,709 million included $6,804 million in development, $709 million in exploration, $139 million in property acquisitions and $57 million in capitalized interest. the 2013 exploration and development expenditures of $6,863 million included $5,952 million in development, $742 million in exploration, $120 million in property acquisitions and $49 million in capitalized interest.  the 2012 exploration and development expenditures of $6,941 million included $5,989 million in development, $901 million in exploration and $50 million in capitalized interest.
the level of exploration and development expenditures, including acquisitions, will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors.  eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives and the ability to adjust its exploration and development expenditure budget as circumstances warrant.  while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to its operations, such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog.
derivative transactions commodity derivative contracts.  the total fair value of eog's crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets at december 31, 2014, as a net asset of $465 million.  presented below is a comprehensive summary of eog's crude oil derivative contracts at february 16, 2015, with notional volumes expressed in barrels per day (bbld) and prices expressed in dollars per barrel ($/bbl).
(1)   eog has entered into crude oil derivative contracts which give counterparties the option to extend certain current derivative contracts for additional six-month periods. options covering a notional volume of 37,000 bbld are exercisable on june 30, 2015. if the counterparties exercise all such options, the notional volume of eog's existing crude oil derivative contracts will increase by 37,000 bbld at an average price of $91.56 per barrel for each month during the period july 1, 2015 through december 31, 2015.
presented below is a comprehensive summary of eog's natural gas derivative contracts at february 16, 2015, with notional volumes expressed in million british thermal units (mmbtu) per day (mmbtud) and prices expressed in dollars per mmbtu ($/mmbtu).
financing eog's debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 25% at december 31, 2014, compared to 28% at december 31, 2013.  as used in this calculation, total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long-term debt and total stockholders' equity.
during 2014, eog funded its capital program primarily by utilizing cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program.  while eog maintains a $2.0 billion commercial paper program, the maximum outstanding at any time during 2014 was $345 million, and the amount outstanding at year-end was zero.  the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during 2014 was $31 million with zero outstanding at year-end. the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were $12 million and $0.1 million, respectively, during the year 2014.  eog considers this excess availability, which is backed by its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (credit agreement) described in note 2 to consolidated financial statements, to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs.

(1)   this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, eog's pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement, abandonment and asset retirement obligations (see notes 6, 7 and 15, respectively, to consolidated financial statements).
(2)   amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december 31, 2014. management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog.
(3)   amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services. eog's expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment (for example, pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract).
off-balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships.  such entities or partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities (vie) or special purpose entities (spe), are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes. eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in item 303(a)(4)(ii) of regulation s-k) during any of the periods covered by this report and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future.
foreign currency exchange rate risk during 2014, eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries, including canada, trinidad, the united kingdom, china and argentina.  the foreign currency most significant to eog's operations during 2014 was the canadian dollar.  the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in 2014 impacted both the revenues and expenses of eog's canadian subsidiaries.  however, since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices, the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses. as previously discussed, during the fourth quarter of 2014, eog sold substantially all of its canadian assets. eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk.
eog was party to a foreign currency aggregate swap with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may have resulted from the subsidiary debt. the foreign currency swap expired and was settled contemporaneously with the repayment upon maturity of the subsidiary debt on march 17, 2014 (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).
outlook pricing.  crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile, and this volatility is expected to continue.  as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment, worldwide supplies of crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas, the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers, eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate, ngl, natural gas, ammonia and methanol prices in the future.  the market price of crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas in 2015 will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities, which will in turn impact eog's financial position. as of january 30, 2015, the average 2015 u.s. new york mercantile exchange (nymex) crude oil and natural gas price was $51.86 and $2.85, respectively, representing declines of 44% and 35%, respectively, from the average nymex prices in 2014. see item 1a. risk factors.
including the impact of eog's 2015 crude oil derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on eog's tax position, eog's price sensitivity in 2015 for each $1.00 per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price, combined with the estimated change in ngl price, is approximately $63 million for net income and $93 million for cash flows from operating activities.  including the impact of eog's 2015 natural gas derivative contracts (exclusive of options) and based on eog's tax position and the portion of eog's anticipated natural gas volumes for 2015 for which prices have not been determined under long-term marketing contracts, eog's price sensitivity for each $0.10 per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately $15 million for net income and $22 million for cash flows from operating activities.  for information regarding eog's crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february 16, 2015, see "derivative transactions" above.
capital. eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states. in particular, eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford, delaware basin and bakken plays.
the total anticipated 2015 capital expenditures of $4.9 to $5.1 billion, excluding acquisitions, is structured to maintain eog's strategy of capital discipline by funding its exploration, development and exploitation activities primarily from available internally generated cash flows and cash on hand. eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives, including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities, bank borrowings, borrowings under its credit agreement and equity and debt offerings.
operations. in 2015, eog does not plan to increase crude oil production in the current low commodity price environment. overall production in 2015 is expected to decline modestly from 2014 levels, and total crude oil production is expected to be flat as compared to the prior year. in 2015, eog expects to allocate capital primarily to its highest rate-of-return crude oil assets, focus on cost reductions and seek out opportunities to acquire high-quality acreage at low costs.
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes.  eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of eog's financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity and complexity in their application.  critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown.  management routinely discusses the development, selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies.  following is a discussion of eog's most critical accounting policies:
proved oil and gas reserves eog's engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations, which directly impact financial accounting estimates, including depreciation, depletion and amortization and impairments of proved properties.  proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, ngl and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made.  the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex, requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir.  the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional development activity, evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.  consequently, material revisions (upward or downward) to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.  for related discussion, see item 1a. risk factors and "supplemental information to consolidated financial statements."
oil and gas exploration costs eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.  oil and gas exploration costs, other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells, are charged to expense as incurred.  the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves.  exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production, a conclusive formation test or certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore.  if proved commercial reserves are not discovered, such drilling costs are expensed.  in some circumstances, it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed.  such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  as of december 31, 2012, eog had exploratory drilling costs related to a project in the united kingdom that had been deferred for more than one year (see note 16 to consolidated financial statements).  these costs met the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization.  costs to develop proved reserves, including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas, are capitalized.
depreciation, depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eog's calculation of depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense. holding all other factors constant, if reserves were revised upward or downward, earnings would increase or decrease, respectively.
depreciation, depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit-of-production method.  the reserve base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves.  with respect to lease and well equipment costs, which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs, the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves.  estimated future dismantlement, restoration and abandonment costs, net of salvage values, are taken into account.
oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries - oil and gas topic of the asc.  the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition, such as a reservoir or field.
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs, reserve revisions (upwards or downwards) and additions, property acquisitions and/or property dispositions and impairments.
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred.  unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated, and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term.  if the unproved properties are determined to be productive, the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties.  lease rentals are expensed as incurred.
when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired, eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a depreciation, depletion and amortization group level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset.  if the expected undiscounted future cash flows, based on eog's estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data, are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value.  fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc.  in certain instances, eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value.  estimates of undiscounted future cash flows require significant judgment.  crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past, and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future.  during the past five years, west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately $53.45 per barrel to $113.39 per barrel, and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately $1.82 per mmbtu to $8.15 per mmbtu.  eog's proved reserves estimates, including the timing of future production, are also subject to significant assumptions and judgment, and are frequently revised (upwards and downwards) as more information becomes available.  in the future, if actual crude oil and/or natural gas prices and/or actual production diverge negatively from eog's current estimates, impairment charges may be necessary.
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach.  under this approach, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate.  significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates.  changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances.
stock-based compensation in accounting for stock-based compensation, judgments and estimates are made regarding, among other things, the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog's common stock, the level of risk-free interest rates, expected dividend yields on eog's common stock, the expected term of the awards, expected volatility of the price of shares of eog's peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change. any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.

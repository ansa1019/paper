item 7.   management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
business and overview overview we are a worldwide operator, franchisor, and licensor of hotels and timeshare properties in 79 countries and territories under numerous brand names. we also develop, operate, and market residential properties and provide services to home/condominium owner associations. under our business model, we typically manage or franchise hotels, rather than own them. at year-end 2014, of the total population of hotel rooms in our system worldwide, we operated 41 percent under management agreements; our franchisees operated 56 percent under franchise agreements; and we owned or leased only two percent. the remainder represented our interest in unconsolidated joint ventures that manage hotels and provide services to franchised properties. we group our operations into three business segments: north american full-service, north american limited-service, and international.
we earn base management fees and in many cases incentive management fees from the properties that we manage, and we earn franchise fees on the properties that others operate under franchise agreements with us. base fees typically consist of a percentage of property-level revenue while incentive fees typically consist of a percentage of net house profit adjusted for a specified owner return. net house profit is calculated as gross operating profit (house profit) less non-controllable expenses such as insurance, real estate taxes, capital spending reserves, and the like.
our emphasis on long-term management contracts and franchising tends to provide more stable earnings in periods of economic softness, while adding new hotels to our system generates growth, typically with little or no investment by the company. this strategy has driven substantial growth while minimizing financial leverage and risk in a cyclical industry. in addition, we believe minimizing our capital investments and adopting a strategy of recycling the investments that we do make maximizes and maintains our financial flexibility.
we remain focused on doing the things that we do well; that is, selling rooms, taking care of our guests, and making sure we control costs both at company-operated properties and at the corporate level ("above-property"). our brands remain strong as a result of skilled management teams, dedicated associates, superior customer service with an emphasis on guest and associate satisfaction, significant distribution, our marriott rewards and the ritz-carlton rewards loyalty programs, a multichannel reservations system, and desirable property amenities. we strive to effectively leverage our size and broad distribution.
we, along with owners and franchisees, continue to invest in our brands by means of new, refreshed, and reinvented properties, new room and public space designs, and enhanced amenities and technology offerings. we address, through various means, hotels in the system that do not meet standards. we continue to enhance the appeal of our proprietary, information-rich, and easy-to-use website, marriott.com, and of our associated mobile smartphone applications and mobile website that connect to marriott.com, through functionality and service improvements, and we expect to continue capturing an increasing proportion of property-level reservations via this cost-efficient channel.
our profitability, as well as that of owners and franchisees, has benefited from our approach to property-level and above-property productivity. properties in our system continue to maintain very tight cost controls. we also control above-property costs, some of which we allocate to hotels, by remaining focused on systems, processing, and support areas.
performance measures we believe revenue per available room ("revpar"), which we calculate by dividing room sales for comparable properties by room nights available for the period, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because it measures the period-over-period change in room revenues for comparable properties. revpar may not be comparable to similarly titled measures, such as revenues. we also believe occupancy and average daily rate ("adr"), which are components of calculating revpar, are meaningful indicators of our performance. occupancy, which we calculate by dividing occupied rooms by total rooms available, measures the utilization of a property's available capacity. adr, which we calculate by dividing property room revenue by total rooms sold, measures average room price and is useful in assessing pricing levels.
we define our comparable properties as those that were open and operating under one of our brands for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the current period and have not, in either the current or previous periods presented, (i) undergone significant room or public space renovations or expansions, (ii) been converted between company-operated and franchised, or (iii) sustained substantial property damage or business interruption. comparable properties represented the following percentages of our properties for each year indicated: (1) 87% of north american properties in 2014, 89% in 2013, and 93% in 2012; (2) 57% of international properties (71% excluding protea hotels) in 2014, 75% in 2013, and 78% in 2012; and (3) 82% of total properties (85% excluding protea hotels) in 2014, 87% in 2013, and 91% in 2012.
we also believe company-operated house profit margin, which is the ratio of property-level gross operating profit (also known as house profit) to total property-level revenue, is a meaningful indicator of our performance because this ratio measures our overall ability as the operator to produce property-level profits by generating sales and controlling the operating expenses over which we have the most direct control. house profit includes room, food and beverage, and other revenue and the related expenses including payroll and benefits expenses, as well as repairs and maintenance, utility, general and administrative, and sales and marketing expenses. house profit does not include the impact of management fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement reserves, insurance, taxes, or other fixed expenses.
strong u.s. group business and transient demand contributed to increased room rate growth in 2014. transient demand continued to be strong in the western u.s. during 2014, and was stronger beginning in the third quarter in the eastern u.s. when compared to the first half of the year, as we eliminated discounts, shifted business into higher rated price categories, and raised room rates. in new york city, new lodging supply continued to constrain rate growth, while in washington d.c., demand strengthened in the second half of the year due to increased city-wide events and a favorable comparison to the 2013 government sequestration and shutdown.
in 2014, bookings for future group business in the u.s. improved. as of year-end 2014, the group revenue pace for stays in 2015 for company-operated full service hotels (marriott, jw marriott, renaissance, the ritz-carlton, and gaylord brands) in north america was up about 5 percent, compared to the 2013 year-end group revenue booking pace for stays in 2014. the higher pace reflected improved group demand and greater pricing power.
the europe region experienced increased demand throughout 2014, most predominately in the united kingdom and central europe primarily due to increased business travel and special events, whereas results in france reflected the impact of a weaker economy. eastern europe was impacted by lower demand, constrained by continued economic deterioration due to the russia/ukraine conflict. in the asia pacific region, 2014 demand continued to increase, led by growth from corporate and other transient business in japan, indonesia, india, and singapore. demand increased in greater china in the first three quarters of 2014 but was also constrained by supply growth in certain southern china markets and government austerity in beijing. in the fourth quarter, demand moderated in greater china due to political disruption in hong kong. demand in malaysia was weak in 2014 due to slower leisure travel from greater china. thailand demand was weak due to political instability through most of 2014 but increased in the fourth quarter. demand for our hotels in our middle east and africa regions remained strong throughout 2014. in particular, demand in egypt improved due to improved political stability. demand in the united arab emirates was constrained mainly by new supply and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in travelers from russia in the second half of the year, while kuwait experienced weakness due to reduced government spending. in the caribbean and latin america, strong demand throughout the region in 2014 was driven by increased leisure travel to our caribbean and mexican resorts, constrained somewhat by oversupply of hotels in panama.
we monitor market conditions and carefully price our rooms daily in accordance with individual property demand levels, generally adjusting room rates as demand changes. we also modify the mix of our business to increase revenue as demand changes. demand for higher rated rooms improved in most markets in 2014, which allowed us to reduce discounting and special offers for transient business in many markets. this mix improvement benefited average daily rates. for our company-
operated properties, we continue to focus on enhancing property-level house profit margins and making productivity improvements.
revenues increased by $1,012 million (8 percent) to $13,796 million in 2014 from $12,784 million in 2013 as a result of higher cost reimbursements revenue ($764 million), higher franchise fees ($79 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue ($72 million), higher base management fees ($51 million), and higher incentive management fees ($46 million). we estimate that the three fewer days of activity in 2014 compared to 2013 reduced fee revenues by approximately $5 million.
cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. the $764 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $11,055 million in 2014 from $10,291 million in 2013, reflected the impact of higher occupancies at our properties and growth across the system.
the $51 million increase in total base management fees, to $672 million in 2014 from $621 million in 2013, largely reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand ($34 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($21 million), and increased recognition of previously deferred fees ($16 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($8 million), decreased fees due to properties that converted from managed to franchised ($8 million), unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($6 million), and three fewer days of activity ($2 million). the $79 million increase in total franchise fees, to $745 million in 2014 from $666 million in 2013, reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand ($35 million), new unit growth across the system ($35 million), increased relicensing fees ($10 million), and fees from properties that converted to franchised from managed ($7 million), partially offset by a decrease in fees from terminated units ($4 million) and three fewer days of activity ($3 million). the $46 million increase in incentive management fees to $302 million in 2014 from $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher net house profit at our north american and international managed hotels in addition to unit growth in international markets, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($5 million) and higher north american full-service deferred fees recognized in 2013 ($5 million).
the $72 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, to $1,022 million in 2014 from $950 million in 2013 predominantly reflected $56 million of higher owned and leased revenue, $17 million in revenue from various protea hotels programs, $9 million in higher branding fees, and $2 million in other program revenue, partially offset by $14 million lower termination fee revenue in 2014. higher owned and leased revenue reflected $43 million from protea hotel leases associated with the acquisition, $30 million in revenue from a north american full-service managed property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, and stronger performance across our new and existing owned and leased properties primarily from the international segment, partially offset by $37 million attributable to five international segment properties that converted to managed or franchised properties. combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $127 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2013.
revenues increased by $970 million (8 percent) to $12,784 million in 2013 from $11,814 million in 2012 as a result of: higher cost reimbursements revenue ($886 million), higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), and higher incentive management fees ($24 million, comprised of a $27 million increase for north america and a $3 million decrease outside of north america), partially offset by lower owned, leased, and other revenue ($39 million). we estimate that the $970 million increase in revenues included $8 million of combined base management fee, franchise fee, and incentive management fee revenues due to the additional four days of activity in 2013 compared to 2012.
cost reimbursements revenue represents reimbursements of costs incurred on behalf of managed and franchised properties and relates, predominantly, to payroll costs at managed properties where we are the employer. as we record cost reimbursements based upon costs incurred with no added markup, this revenue and related expense has no impact on either our operating or net income. the $886 million increase in total cost reimbursements revenue, to $10,291 million in 2013 from $9,405 million in 2012, reflected the impact of higher property-level demand and growth across the system.
the $40 million increase in total base management fees, to $621 million in 2013 from $581 million in 2012, mainly reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand ($18 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($18 million), primarily driven by gaylord brand properties we began managing in the fourth quarter of 2012, and the additional four days of activity (approximately $3 million). the $59 million increase in total franchise fees, to $666 million in 2013 from $607 million in 2012, primarily reflected stronger revpar due to increased demand ($22 million), the impact of unit growth across the system ($23 million), increased relicensing fees primarily for certain north american limited-service properties ($8 million), and the additional four days of activity (approximately $5 million). the $24 million increase in incentive management fees from $232 million in 2012 to $256 million in 2013 largely reflected higher property-level income at managed hotels ($33 million), particularly full-service hotels in north america, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates ($3 million) and unfavorable variances from the following 2012 items: recognition of incentive management fees due to contract revisions for certain international segment properties ($3 million) and recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with an international segment property's change in ownership ($3 million).
the $39 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, to $950 million in 2013 from $989 million in 2012, primarily reflected $35 million of lower corporate housing revenue due to the sale of the execustay corporate housing business in the 2012 second quarter and $28 million of lower owned and leased revenue, partially offset by $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue. lower owned and leased revenue primarily reflected fewer international segment leased properties due to three leases that we terminated in 2013 and weaker demand at one leased property in london, as well as a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company. combined branding fees for credit card endorsements and the sale of branded residential real estate by others totaled $118 million in 2013 and $106 million in 2012.
depreciation, amortization and other expense increased by $21 million (17 percent) to $148 million in 2014 from $127 million in 2013. the increase reflected the $25 million net impairment charge on the edition hotels discussed in footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions," $5 million in accelerated amortization related to contract terminations, $5 million in higher contract amortization primarily from protea hotels, and $3 million in higher depreciation related to a north american full-service property that we acquired in the 2013 fourth quarter, partially offset by $13 million of accelerated amortization related to contract terminations in 2013 and $5 million of 2013 depreciation for two international properties that converted to managed contracts.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $10 million (2 percent) to $659 million in 2014 from $649 million in 2013. the increase largely reflected $9 million from the addition of protea hotels and related transition costs, $7 million from net unfavorable foreign exchange rates, and $6 million of increased guarantee funding, partially offset by $8 million litigation settlements recognized in 2013, and a $5 million performance cure payment in 2013 for an international segment property.
operating income increased by $48 million to $988 million in 2013 from $940 million in 2012. the $48 million increase in operating income reflected a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, and $17 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by a $67 million increase in general, administrative and other expenses and a $25 million increase in depreciation, amortization, and other expenses. approximately $7 million of the net increase in operating income was due to the additional four days of activity in 2013. we discuss the reasons for the increases in base management fees, franchise fees, and incentive management fees compared to 2012 in the preceding "revenues" section.
the $17 million (8 percent) increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was largely attributable to $12 million of higher branding fees, $8 million of higher hotel agreement termination fees, and $2 million of higher other revenue, partially offset by $6 million of lower owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses. lower owned and leased revenue, net of direct expenses was due to $7 million in costs related to three international segment leases we terminated, $5 million in lower results at one leased property in london, $7 million in pre-opening expenses for the london and miami beach edition hotels, and a $2 million business interruption payment received in the 2012 second quarter from a utility company for our leased property in japan, partially offset by $16 million in net favorable results at several leased properties.
depreciation, amortization, and other expenses increased by $25 million (25 percent) to $127 million in 2013 from $102 million in 2012. the $25 million increase largely reflected $18 million of impairment and accelerated amortization expense for deferred contract acquisition costs primarily for properties that left our system or which had cash flow shortfalls, $5 million in higher depreciation at two leased international properties due to an asset write-off and the impact of renovations, $4 million of higher amortization expense year over year for deferred contract acquisition costs related to our 2012 acquisition of the gaylord brand and hotel management company, $2 million in higher depreciation for two newly acquired properties, and $2 million in higher depreciation for an international property following a conversion to franchised. these increases were partially offset by a favorable variance from the accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs in 2012 for a property that exited our system.
general, administrative, and other expenses increased by $67 million (12 percent) to $649 million in 2013 from $582 million in 2012. the $67 million increase reflected $32 million in higher other expenses primarily associated with higher costs in international markets, higher costs for hotel development, and higher costs for branding and service initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, $26 million of higher compensation and other overhead expenses including increases in hotel development staffing and bonus compensation, $5 million performance cure payment for an international segment property, and a $4 million increase in legal expenses, primarily due to favorable litigation settlements in 2012.
impairment of cost method investments and equity securities       -               -              (8   )
gains and other income decreased by $3 million (27 percent) to $8 million in 2014 compared to $11 million in 2013. this decrease in gains and other income reflected a gain of $8 million on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company in the 2013 second quarter, partially offset by $4 million in net distribution from cost method investments (not allocated to any of our segments) in 2014. see footnote no. 14, "fair value of financial instruments" for additional information on the 2013 sale.
gains and other income decreased by $31 million (74 percent) to $11 million in 2013 compared to $42 million in 2012. this decrease in gains and other income principally reflected an unfavorable variance from the $41 million gain we recognized in 2012 on the sale of the equity interest in a north american limited-service joint venture, and a $2 million impairment loss
we recognized in 2013 as a result of measuring certain assets at fair value less the costs we incurred to sell those assets. see footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information on the reclassification of these assets to held for sale. the decrease in gains and other income was partially offset by a gain of $8 million we recognized in 2013 on the sale of a portion of our shares of a publicly traded company and a favorable variance from an other-than-temporary $7 million impairment we recorded in 2012.
interest expense decreased by $5 million (4 percent) to $115 million in 2014 compared to $120 million in 2013. this decrease was principally from $8 million in higher debt premium accretion which included a true-up, $2 million in lower interest on an exited lease obligation, $2 million decrease due to lower interest rates on our marriott rewards program, and a $2 million increase in capitalized interest primarily related to development of edition hotels in miami beach and new york, offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter. this was partially offset by a net $8 million increase due to the issuance of higher net senior note borrowings.
interest expense decreased by $17 million (12 percent) to $120 million in 2013 compared to $137 million in 2012. this decrease in interest expense principally reflected a net $13 million decrease due to net senior note retirements and new senior note issuances at lower interest rates; and $3 million of increased capitalized interest primarily related to developing two edition hotels, partially offset by completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter.
interest income increased by $7 million (30 percent) to $30 million in 2014 compared to $23 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to $6 million earned on the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) provided to an owner in conjunction with entering into a franchise agreement for an international property in the 2014 second quarter, and $2 million earned on the mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest acquired in the 2013 second quarter. see footnote no. 13, "notes receivable" for more information on the mezzanine loan.
interest income increased by $6 million (35 percent) to $23 million in 2013 compared to $17 million in 2012, primarily reflecting $5 million earned on the $65 million mandatorily redeemable preferred equity ownership interest we acquired in the 2013 second quarter. see footnote no. 14, "fair value of financial instruments" for more information on the acquisition.
equity in earnings (losses)
equity in earnings of $6 million in 2014 improved by $11 million from equity in losses of $5 million in 2013. the increase was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate, $9 million in higher earnings from three of our international and one of our north american full-service joint ventures, and a favorable variance from a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate investment (not allocated to any of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we do not expect to recover the investment. this was partially offset by an $11 million litigation reserve associated with another corporate investment (not allocated to any of our segments).
equity in losses of $5 million in 2013 improved by $8 million from equity in losses of $13 million in 2012. the change primarily reflected a favorable variance from the following 2012 items: (1) $8 million in losses at a north american full-service segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties; and (2) a $2 million loan loss provision for certain notes receivable due from an international segment joint venture. these favorable variances were partially offset by a $4 million impairment charge in the 2013 second quarter associated with a corporate joint venture (not allocated to one of our segments) that we determined was fully impaired because we did not expect to recover the investment.
our tax provision increased by $64 million (24 percent) to $335 million in 2014 from $271 million in 2013. the increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, unrealized foreign exchange gains that were taxed within a foreign jurisdiction, and non-recurring favorable foreign true-ups in 2013. the increase was partially offset by the favorable resolution of a u.s. federal tax issue relating to a guest marketing program ($21 million), the release of an international valuation allowance ($7 million), and the resolution of an international financing activity tax issue ($5 million).
our tax provision decreased by $7 million (3 percent) to $271 million in 2013 from $278 million in 2012. the decrease resulted from a lower effective tax rate (30.2 percent in 2013 compared to 32.7 percent in 2012), favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments in 2013, favorable variance from a reserve recorded for an international tax issue in 2012, a favorable state tax adjustment in 2013, and higher income before income taxes in jurisdictions outside of the u.s. with lower tax rates, partially offset by higher income tax expense in the u.s.
net income increased by $127 million to $753 million in 2014 from $626 million in 2013, and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.54 per share (27 percent) to $2.54 per share from $2.00 per share in 2013. as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with "revenues," or as shown in the income statement, the $127 million increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees ($79 million), higher base management fees ($51 million), higher incentive management fees ($46 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($26 million), higher equity in earnings ($11 million), higher interest income ($7 million), and lower interest expense ($5 million). these increases were partially offset by higher income taxes ($64 million), higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense ($21 million), higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($10 million) and lower gains and other income ($3 million).
net income increased by $55 million to $626 million in 2013 from $571 million in 2012, and diluted earnings per share increased by $0.28 per share (16 percent) to $2.00 per share from $1.72 per share in 2012. as discussed in more detail in the preceding sections beginning with "revenues," or as shown in the income statement, the $55 million increase in net income was due to higher franchise fees ($59 million), higher base management fees ($40 million), higher incentive management fees ($24 million), lower interest expense ($17 million), lower equity in losses ($8 million), lower income taxes ($7 million), higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses ($6 million), and higher interest income ($6 million). these increases were partially offset by higher general, administrative, and other expenses ($81 million) and lower gains and other income ($31 million).
earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("ebitda") and adjusted ebitda ebitda, a financial measure not required by, or presented in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles ("gaap"), reflects net income excluding the impact of interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. we believe that ebitda is a meaningful indicator of operating performance because we use it to measure our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, and expand our business. we also use ebitda, as do analysts, lenders, investors, and others, to evaluate companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. for example, interest expense can be dependent on a company's capital structure, debt levels, and credit ratings. accordingly, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. the tax positions of companies can also vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the jurisdictions in which they operate. as a result, effective tax rates and provision for income taxes can vary considerably among companies. ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense which we report under "depreciation, amortization, and other," as well as depreciation included under "reimbursed costs" in our income statements, because companies utilize productive assets of different ages and use different methods of both acquiring and depreciating productive assets. these differences can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies.
we also believe that adjusted ebitda, another non-gaap financial measure, is a meaningful indicator of operating performance. our adjusted ebitda reflects adjustments to exclude (1) pre-tax impairment charges of $25 million in 2014 which we recorded in the "depreciation, amortization, and other" caption of our income statements following an evaluation of our edition hotels and residences for recovery and determination that our cost estimates exceeded our total fixed sales price, and (2) share-based compensation expense for all periods presented. we excluded share-based compensation expense to address considerable variability among companies in recording compensation expense because companies use share-based payment awards differently, both in the type and quantity of awards granted. we believe that adjusted ebitda that excludes these items is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because it permits period-over-period comparisons of our ongoing core operations before these items and facilitates our comparison of results before these items with results from other lodging companies.
ebitda and adjusted ebitda have limitations and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated under gaap. both of these non-gaap measures exclude certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. in addition, other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda and in particular adjusted ebitda differently than we do or may not calculate them at all, limiting the usefulness of ebitda and adjusted ebitda as comparative measures.
we show our 2014 and 2013 ebitda and adjusted ebitda calculations that reflect the changes we describe above and reconcile those measures with net income in the following table:
ebitda                                                                                              $1,390              $1,209
edition impairment charge                                                                               25                   -
adjusted ebitda                                                                                     $1,524              $1,325
business segments during the 2014 first quarter, we modified the information that our president and chief executive officer reviews to be consistent with our continent structure. this structure aligns our business around geographic regions and is designed to enable us to operate more efficiently and to accelerate our worldwide growth. as a result of modifying our reporting information, we revised our operating segments to eliminate our former luxury segment, which we allocated between our existing north american full-service operating segment, and the following four new operating segments: asia pacific, caribbean and latin america, europe, and middle east and africa.
although our north american full-service and north american limited-service segments meet the applicable accounting criteria to be reportable business segments, the four new operating segments do not meet the criteria to be reportable and we therefore combined them into an "all other" category, which we refer to as "international." we have revised our business segment information for earlier periods. see footnote no. 16, "business segments," to our financial statements for further information on our segment changes and other information about each segment, including revenues and a reconciliation of segment results to net income.

the following discussion reflects all three of our segments. we consider total segment revenues and total segment profits (as defined in footnote no. 16, "business segments") to be meaningful indicators of our performance because they measure our growth in profitability and enable investors to compare the revenues and profits of our operations to our competitors.
we added 311 properties (46,050 rooms) and 52 properties (6,418 rooms) exited our system in 2014. these figures do not include residential units. during 2014, we also added two residential properties (30 units) and no residential properties or units exited the system.
total segment revenues increased by $1,022 million to $13,540 million in 2014, an 8 percent increase from revenues of $12,518 million in 2013, and total segment profits increased by $196 million to $1,393 million in 2014 from $1,197 million in 2013.
the year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $1,022 million was a result of a $787 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $58 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, a $51 million increase in base management fees, and a $46 million increase in incentive management fees. the year-over-year increase of $196 million in segment profits reflected an $80 million increase in franchise fees, a $51 million increase in base management fees, a $46 million increase in incentive management fees, $19 million of lower joint venture equity losses, a $11 million increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $4 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by a $16 million increase in general, administrative and other expense. for more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with "revenues."
in 2014, 50 percent of our managed properties paid incentive management fees to us versus 38 percent in 2013. managed properties that paid incentive management fees in 2014 represented 36 percent of properties in north america and 73 percent outside of north america, compared to 21 percent in north america and 70 percent outside of north america in 2013. in addition, in 2014, 56 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside of north america versus 58 percent in 2013. further, we earned $24 million in incentive management fees in 2014 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2013.
compared to 2013, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2014 increased by 120 basis points and worldwide comparable company-operated house profit per available room ("hp-par") increased by 9.7 percent on a constant u.s. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and solid cost controls. these same factors contributed to north american company-operated house profit margins increasing by 150 basis points compared to 2013. hp-par at those same properties increased by 11.4 percent. international company-operated house profit margins increased by 70 basis points, and hp-par at those properties increased by 6.6 percent reflecting increased demand and higher revpar in most locations and improved productivity. note that 2014 had three fewer days of activity when compared to 2013.
we added 161 properties (25,420 rooms) and 51 properties (10,299 rooms) exited our system in 2013. these figures do not include residential units. during 2013, we also added five residential properties (301 units) and no residential properties or units exited the system.
total segment revenues increased by $992 million to $12,518 million in 2013, a 9 percent increase from revenues of $11,526 million in 2012, and total segment profits increased by $32 million to $1,197 million in 2013 from $1,165 million in 2012.
the year-over-year increase in segment revenues of $992 million was a result of a $923 million increase in cost reimbursements revenue, a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, and a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, partially offset by a $54 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue. the year-over-year increase of $32 million in segment profits reflected a $59 million increase in franchise fees, a $40 million increase in base management fees, a $24 million increase in incentive management fees, and $8 million of lower joint venture equity losses, partially offset by a $46 million increase in general, administrative, and other expenses, $44 million of lower gains and other income, and a $9 million decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses. for more information on the variances, see the preceding sections beginning with "revenues."
outside of north america, compared to 15 percent in north america and 70 percent outside of north america in 2012. in addition, in 2013, 58 percent of our incentive fees came from properties outside the united states versus 65 percent in 2012. further, we earned $14 million in incentive management fees in 2013 from properties that did not earn any incentive management fees in 2012.
compared to 2012, worldwide comparable company-operated house profit margins in 2013 increased by 90 basis points and hp-par increased by 6.2 percent on a constant u.s. dollar basis, reflecting higher occupancy, rate increases, improved productivity, and lower energy costs. note that 2013 had four additional days of activity when compared to 2012.
development we added 311 properties, totaling 46,050 rooms, across our brands in 2014, and 52 properties (6,418 rooms) left the system, not including residential products. we also added two residential properties (30 units) and no residential properties left the system. highlights of the year included:
•   converting 32 properties (8,885 rooms), or 19 percent of our gross room additions for the year, to our brands;
•   adding approximately 60 percent of all the new rooms outside the united states; and
•   adding 120 properties (13,928 rooms) to our north american limited-service brands.
we believe that we have access to sufficient financial resources to finance our growth, as well as to support our ongoing operations and meet debt service and other cash requirements. nonetheless, our ability to develop and update our brands and the ability of hotel developers to build or acquire new marriott-branded properties, both of which are important parts of our growth plan, depend in part on capital access, availability and cost for other hotel developers and third-party owners. these growth plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. see the "forward-looking statements" and "risks and uncertainties" captions earlier in this report and the "liquidity and capital resources" caption later in this report.

segment profits         $524                $490                $442                 7   %                     11   %
the $34 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, was driven by $30 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher incentive management fees, and $5 million of lower depreciation, amortization, and other expense, partially offset by $11 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $8 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses.
higher base management and franchise fees were due to stronger revpar as a result of increased demand and unit growth, partially offset by $7 million from terminated units. the increase in incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels, partially offset by $5 million in deferred fees recognized in 2013.
the $48 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2012, was driven by $39 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $23 million of higher incentive management fees, $10 million of lower joint venture losses and $3 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by $16 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses and $11 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense.
higher base management and franchise fees stemmed from both higher revpar due to increased demand and unit growth, including the gaylord brand properties we began managing in 2012, a favorable variance from $2 million of fee reversals in 2012 for a property with a contract revision, and also reflected fees for the additional four days of activity. the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level income resulting from higher property-level revenue and margins.
higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses was primarily driven by our recognition in 2013 of $7 million in termination fees for five properties, $6 million of stronger earnings at two leased and one owned property, and $5 million of higher branding fees and other revenue, partially offset by our recognition in 2012 of a $14 million termination fee for one property and $2 million in pre-opening expenses for the miami beach edition in 2013.
the increase in depreciation, amortization, and other expense resulted from an $11 million impairment of deferred contract acquisition costs primarily related to three properties that left the system and one property that converted to a franchised property, $5 million of higher amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs associated with the gaylord brand and hotel management company and depreciation from the acquisition of a property, partially offset by a favorable variance from the 2012 accelerated amortization of $8 million of deferred contract acquisition costs for a property that exited our system and for which we earned the $14 million termination fee mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
the decrease in joint venture equity losses reflected a favorable variance from $8 million in losses in 2012 at a north american full-service segment joint venture for the impairment of certain underlying residential properties.
north american limited-service includes ac hotels by marriott, courtyard, residence inn, springhill suites, fairfield inn & suites, and towneplace suites located in the united states and canada.

in 2014, across our north american limited-service segment we added 120 properties (13,928 rooms) and 32 properties (3,030 rooms) left the system. the majority of the properties that left the system were fairfield inn & suites and residence inn properties.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2014, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, revpar for comparable systemwide north american limited-service properties increased by 7.5 percent to $89.11, occupancy for these properties increased by 2.3 percentage points to 74.0 percent, and average daily rates increased by 4.2 percent to $120.36.
the $95 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2013, primarily reflected $80 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, and $7 million of higher incentive management fees.
higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher revpar for comparable properties and unit growth, and included $15 million of higher deferred management fees and $10 million of higher relicensing fees. increased incentive management fees resulted from net house profit growth at managed hotels.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american limited-service segment properties totaled $2,217 million in 2014, compared to $1,939 million in 2013.
in 2013, across our north american limited-service segment we added 108 properties (12,927 rooms) and 22 properties (2,427 rooms) left the system. the majority of the properties that left the system were courtyard and fairfield inn & suites properties. in the 2012 second quarter, we completed the sale of our execustay corporate housing business. the revenues,
results of operations, assets, and liabilities of our execustay business were not material to the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows for any of the periods presented.
for the twelve months ended december 31, 2013, compared to the twelve months ended december 31, 2012, revpar for comparable systemwide north american limited-service properties increased by 4.4 percent to $82.52, occupancy for these properties increased by 0.7 percentage points to 71.8 percent, and average daily rates increased by 3.4 percent to $115.00.
the $7 million increase in segment profits, compared to 2012, primarily reflected $45 million of higher base management and franchise fees and $4 million of higher incentive management fees, partially offset by $43 million of lower gains and other income.
higher base management and franchise fees were primarily driven by higher revpar due to increased demand, some of which was attributable to the favorable effect of property renovations, and higher relicensing fees, as well as the additional four days of activity, partially offset by an unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of $7 million of deferred base management fees in conjunction with the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture. the increase in incentive management fees primarily reflected higher property-level revenue which resulted in higher property-level income and margins. lower gains and other income primarily reflected an unfavorable variance from a $41 million gain on the sale of our equity interest in a joint venture in 2012. see the "gains and other income" caption earlier in this report for more information on the sale of this equity interest.
cost reimbursements revenue and expenses for our north american limited-service segment properties totaled $1,939 million in 2013, compared to $1,832 million in 2012.
international includes properties, regardless of brand, that are located outside the united states and canada.

the $67 million increase in segment profits in 2014, compared to 2013, primarily consisted of $22 million in higher incentive management fees, $21 million of higher base management and franchise fees, $17 million of higher equity in earnings, and $11 million of higher owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, partially offset by $6 million higher general, administrative, and other expenses.
the increase in base management and franchise fees was driven by unit growth and higher revpar, partially offset by the impact of $3 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates and $4 million from terminated units. increased incentive management fees were primarily driven by higher net house profit at managed hotels and unit growth, partially offset by the impact of $4 million in unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
the increase of equity in earnings was driven by a $9 million reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with a tax law change in a country in which two of our international joint ventures operate and $7 million in increased earnings at three of our joint ventures.
the increase in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected $10 million from protea hotels programs and leases acquired in the 2014 second quarter, $5 million in higher costs in 2013 related to three leases we terminated, $5 million of pre-opening costs in 2013, $4 million from new units, and $4 million of favorable operating profits, partially offset by an unfavorable variance of $12 million in termination fees recognized in 2013, and $6 million in earnings from properties that converted to managed or franchised.
the increase in general, administrative, and other expenses was primarily due to $5 million related to the protea hotels acquisition and $5 million in higher compensation, partially offset by a $5 million performance cure payment for one property in 2013.
the $23 million decrease in segment profits in 2013, compared to 2012, predominantly reflected $17 million of higher general, administrative, and other expenses, $9 million of higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense, $5 million of lower owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses, $3 million of lower incentive management fees, and $3 million of increased joint venture equity losses, partially offset by $15 million of higher base management and franchise fees.
the increase in base management and franchise fees largely reflected new unit growth and higher revpar due to increased demand. the decrease in incentive management fees was primarily driven by a $3 million unfavorable impact from a contract revision for a property, a $2 million unfavorable variance from the 2012 recognition of previously deferred fees in conjunction with a property's change in ownership, and a $3 million unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact. these were partially offset by higher property-level revenue which resulted in higher property-level income and margins and net new unit growth.
the decrease in owned, leased, and other revenue, net of direct expenses largely reflected $7 million in costs related to three international segment leases we terminated, $5 million in weaker earnings at one leased property in london, and $5 million of pre-opening expenses for the london edition, partially offset by $12 million of higher termination fees principally associated with three properties.
higher depreciation, amortization, and other expense resulted primarily from $4 million of assets written off at two properties and $3 million due to new unit growth and renovations at two properties.
the increase in general, administrative, and other expenses primarily reflected $14 million of increased expenses for initiatives to enhance and grow our brands globally, $7 million of higher accounts receivable reserves primarily related to two properties, and a $5 million performance cure payment for one property, partially offset by a favorable variance from a $5 million guarantee accrual for one property in 2012.
higher joint venture equity losses were primarily driven by a renovation at a hotel in one joint venture and lower earnings at two other joint ventures.
share-based compensation under our stock and cash incentive plan, we award: (1) stock options to purchase our common stock; (2) stock appreciation rights ("sars") for our common stock; (3) restricted stock units ("rsus") of our common stock; and (4) deferred stock units.
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements and our credit facilities on july 18, 2013, we amended and restated our multicurrency revolving credit agreement (the "credit facility") to extend the facility's expiration to july 18, 2018 and increase the facility size to $2,000 million of aggregate effective borrowings. the material terms of the amended and restated credit facility otherwise did not change. the facility supports general corporate needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, and letters of credit. the availability of the credit facility also supports our commercial paper program. borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor (the london interbank offered rate), plus a spread based on our public debt rating. we also pay quarterly fees on the credit facility at a rate based on our public debt rating. for more information on our credit facility, see exhibit 10, "third amended and restated credit agreement," to our current report on form 8-k that we filed with the sec on july 19, 2013.
the credit facility contains certain covenants, including a single financial covenant that limits our maximum leverage (consisting of the ratio of adjusted total debt to consolidated ebitda, each as defined in the credit facility) to not more than 4 to 1. our outstanding public debt does not contain a corresponding financial covenant or a requirement that we maintain certain financial ratios. we currently satisfy the covenants in our credit facility and public debt instruments, including the leverage covenant under the credit facility, and do not expect that the covenants will restrict our ability to meet our anticipated borrowing and guarantee levels, or increase those levels should we decide to do so in the future.
we believe the credit facility and our access to capital markets, together with cash we expect to generate from operations, will remain adequate to meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, finance our long-term growth plans, meet debt service, and fulfill our other cash requirements.
we issue commercial paper in the united states. we do not have purchase commitments from buyers for our commercial paper; therefore, our ability to issue commercial paper is subject to market demand. we classify any outstanding commercial paper and credit facility borrowings as long-term debt based on our ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis. we reserve unused capacity under our credit facility to repay outstanding commercial paper borrowings in the event that the commercial paper market is not available to us for any reason when outstanding borrowings mature. we do not expect that fluctuations in the demand for commercial paper will affect our liquidity, given our borrowing capacity under the credit facility.
at year-end 2014, our available borrowing capacity amounted to $1,032 million and reflected borrowing capacity of $928 million under our credit facility and our cash balance of $104 million. we calculated that borrowing capacity by taking $2,000 million of effective aggregate bank commitments under our credit facility and subtracting $1,072 million of outstanding commercial paper (there being no outstanding letters of credit under our credit facility).
we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the effect that changes in capital market conditions may have on our ability to execute our announced growth plans. we expect to continue meeting part of our financing and liquidity needs primarily through commercial paper borrowings, issuances of senior notes, and access to long-term committed credit facilities. if conditions in the lodging industry deteriorate, or if disruptions in the capital markets take place as they did in the immediate aftermath of both the 2008 worldwide financial crisis and the events of september 11, 2001, we may be unable to place some or all of our commercial paper on a temporary or extended basis and may have to rely more on borrowings under the credit facility, which we believe will be adequate to fund our liquidity needs, including repayment of debt obligations, but which may or may not carry a higher cost than commercial paper. since we continue to have ample flexibility under the credit facility's covenants, we expect that undrawn bank commitments under the credit facility will remain available to us even if business conditions were to deteriorate markedly.
cash from operations cash from operations and non-cash items for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
non-cash items (1)           328                 316               420
our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 0.6 to 1.0 at year-end 2014 and 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2013. we minimize working capital through cash management, strict credit-granting policies, and aggressive collection efforts. we also have significant borrowing capacity under our credit facility should we need additional working capital.
our ratios of earnings to fixed charges for the last five fiscal years, the calculations of which we detail in exhibit 12 to this 2014 annual report on form 10-k, are as follows:
6.2x        5.1x        4.6x        2.3x        2.9x spin-off cash tax benefits tax matters that could affect our cash tax benefits related to the 2011 spin-off of our timeshare operations and timeshare development business were resolved in 2013, and we expect that the spin-off will result in our realization through 2015 of approximately $480 million of cash tax benefits, relating to the value of the timeshare business. we realized $447 million of those benefits through 2014 and expect to realize approximately $33 million of cash tax benefits in 2015.
investing activities cash flows capital expenditures and other investments. we made capital expenditures of $411 million in 2014, $296 million in 2013, and $437 million in 2012. these included expenditures related to the development and construction of new hotels and acquisitions of hotel properties, improvements to existing properties, and systems initiatives. capital expenditures in 2014 increased by $115 million compared to 2013, primarily related to developing two edition hotels and our 2014 acquisition of a property in our international segment, partially offset by the completion of the london edition in the 2013 fourth quarter (see footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions" for more information). capital expenditures in 2013 decreased by $141 million compared to 2012, primarily due to the 2012 acquisition of land and a building that we used to develop an edition hotel.
we expect 2015 investment spending will total approximately $600 million to $800 million, including approximately $125 million for maintenance capital spending and approximately $135 million (c$168 million) for the expected acquisition of delta hotels. investment spending also includes other capital expenditures (including property acquisitions, construction, and renovations), loan advances, contract acquisition costs, and equity and other investments.
over time, we have sold lodging properties, both completed and under development, subject to long-term management agreements. the ability of third-party purchasers to raise the debt and equity capital necessary to acquire such properties depends in part on the perceived risks inherent in the lodging industry and other constraints inherent in the capital markets as a whole. we monitor the status of the capital markets and regularly evaluate the potential impact of changes in capital market conditions on our business operations. we expect to continue making selective and opportunistic investments to add units to our lodging business, which may include loans and noncontrolling equity investments.
fluctuations in the values of hotel real estate generally have little impact on our overall business results because: (1) we own less than one percent of hotels that we operate or franchise; (2) management and franchise fees are generally based upon hotel revenues and profits rather than current hotel property values; and (3) our management agreements generally do not terminate upon hotel sale or foreclosure.
dispositions. property and asset sales generated $435 million cash proceeds in 2014 and $65 million in 2012. see footnote no. 3, "acquisitions and dispositions," for more information on completed dispositions and planned dispositions.
loan activity. from time to time we make loans to owners of hotels that we operate or franchise. loan advances, net of loan collections, amounted to $69 million in 2014 compared to net collections of $70 million in 2013. at year-end 2014, we had a $3 million senior loan and $239 million of mezzanine and other loans ($215 million noncurrent and $24 million current) outstanding, compared with a $3 million senior loan and $175 million of mezzanine and other loans ($142 million noncurrent and $36 million current) outstanding at year-end 2013. in 2014, our notes receivable balance for senior, mezzanine, and other loans increased by $64 million, primarily reflecting the issuance of the $85 million mezzanine loan (net of a $15 million discount) described in footnote no. 13, "notes receivable," partially offset by $31 million of collections on mvw notes receivable issued to us in 2011 in conjunction with our timeshare spin-off.
equity and cost method investments. cash outflows of $6 million in 2014, $16 million in 2013, and $15 million in 2012 for equity and cost method investments primarily reflects our investments in a number of joint ventures.
cash from financing activities debt. debt increased by $582 million in 2014, to $3,781 million at year-end 2014 from $3,199 million at year-end 2013, and reflected our 2014 fourth quarter issuance of $394 million (book value) of series n notes and a $238 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by a $53 million reduction in other debt. debt increased by $264 million in 2013, to $3,199 million at year-end 2013 from $2,935 million at year-end 2012, and reflected our 2013 third quarter issuance of $348 million (book value) of series m notes and a $333 million increase in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by the $400 million (book value) retirement, at maturity, of our series j notes, $15 million in decreased borrowings under our credit facility, and a $2 million reduction in other debt. see footnote no. 10, "long-term debt" for additional information on the debt issuances.
our financial objectives include diversifying our financing sources, optimizing the mix and maturity of our long-term debt, and reducing our working capital. at year-end 2014, our long-term debt had an average interest rate of 3.0 percent and an average maturity of approximately 4.6 years. the ratio of our fixed-rate long-term debt to our total long-term debt was 0.7 to 1.0 at year-end 2014.
see the "cash requirements and our credit facilities," caption in this "liquidity and capital resources" section for more information on our credit facility.

the preceding table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits at year-end 2014 of $10 million. see footnote no. 6, "income taxes" for additional information.
in addition to the purchase obligations noted in the preceding table, in the normal course of business we enter into purchase commitments to manage the daily operating needs of the hotels that we manage. since we are reimbursed from the cash flows of the hotels, these obligations have minimal impact on our net income and cash flow.
guarantee commitments the following table summarizes our guarantee commitments at year-end 2014:

for further information on our investment commitments, including the nature of the commitments and their expirations, see the "commitments" caption in footnote no. 7, "commitments and contingencies."
letters of credit at year-end 2014, we also had $87 million of letters of credit outstanding (all outside the credit facility), the majority of which were for our self-insurance programs. surety bonds issued as of year-end 2014 totaled $153 million, the majority of which federal, state, and local governments requested in connection with our self-insurance programs.
related party transactions equity method investments we have equity method investments in entities that own properties for which we provide management and/or franchise services and receive fees. we also have equity method investments in entities that provide management and/or franchise services to hotels and receive fees. in addition, in some cases we provide loans, preferred equity, or guarantees to these entities. undistributed earnings attributable to our equity method investments represented approximately $3 million of our consolidated retained earnings at year-end 2014. for other information on these equity method investments, including the impact to our financial statements of transactions with these related parties, see footnote no. 17, "related party transactions."
critical accounting policies and estimates our preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) we must make assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and (2) changes in the estimate, or selection of a different estimate methodology could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
while we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information available at the time the estimate or assumption was made. actual results may differ significantly. additionally, changes in our
assumptions, estimates or assessments as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors, and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them.
see footnote no. 2, "summary of significant accounting policies," for further information on our critical accounting policies and estimates, which are as follows:
goodwill, including how we evaluate the fair value of reporting units and when we record an impairment loss on goodwill;
loan loss reserves, including information on how we measure impairment on senior, mezzanine, and other loans of these types; and income taxes, including information on how we determine our current year amounts payable or refundable, as well as our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

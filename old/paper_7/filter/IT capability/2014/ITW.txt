item 7. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc. (the "company" or "itw") is a global manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately 90 divisions in 57 countries. as of december 31, 2014, the company employed approximately 49,000 persons.
due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company's decentralized operating structure, the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. instead, the company's corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.
enterprise strategy in 2012, the company embarked on an enterprise strategy with the objective of fully leveraging itw's core capabilities to deliver strong financial performance. itw's enterprise strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. these enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.
the foundation of this strategy is a set of business practices referred to as the itw business model consisting of three core elements:
80/20 business process - the concept of the 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). the company uses this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key drivers of business profitability, and as a result, reduces complexity that often creates unnecessary expense and disguises what is truly important. the company utilizes the 80/20 process in all aspects of its business. common applications of the 80/20 business process include:
•   simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.
•   designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.
the result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. these 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs, and improve profitability and returns.
customer-back innovation - itw's customer-back approach to innovation builds on the company's 80/20 business process to help itw businesses focus on the most profitable customers and invent solutions to solve their specific problems. itw businesses are focused on building relationships with these major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their needs. these customer insights and learnings drive innovation at itw. the company actively protects its innovation through a patent portfolio of approximately 10,000 active patents.
decentralized entrepreneurial culture - itw businesses have significant flexibility within the framework of the itw business model to customize their approach in order to best serve their customers. this leads to a focused and simple organizational structure that can deliver operational excellence adapted to their customers and end markets.
key initiatives itw's enterprise strategy is centered on three key initiatives - portfolio management, business structure simplification, and strategic sourcing. these enterprise initiatives are expected to enhance the business through 2017 and are targeted at expanding organic revenue growth and improving profitability and returns.
portfolio management - the company's portfolio management initiative aims to construct a business portfolio that leverages the company's differentiated business model and growth potential. as part of this initiative, the company reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. as a result, the company's divestiture activity increased in 2012, 2013 and 2014. with the sale of the company's former industrial packaging segment on may 1, 2014, the divestiture element of the company's portfolio management initiative is essentially complete. the company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. going forward, the company will emphasize organic growth, while acquisitions will be targeted to bolt-on acquisitions that support and accelerate organic growth in existing segments, and new platforms that expand the company's long-term growth and earnings potential. refer to the discontinued operations note in item 8 - financial statements and supplementary data for discussion of the company's discontinued operations.
another key aspect of the portfolio management initiative is the focus on product line and customer base simplification. product line and customer base simplification focuses on eliminating the complexity and overhead costs associated with smaller product lines and customers, and focuses businesses on supporting and growing their largest customers and product lines. product line and customer base simplification is a core element of the company's 80/20 business process. in the short-term, product line and customer base simplification may result in a decrease in revenue and overhead costs while improving operating margin. over the long-term, product line and customer base simplification results in growth in revenue, profitability and returns, and is key to improving the company's long-term operating and financial performance.
business structure simplification - the business structure simplification initiative simplifies the company's organizational model and adds scale to the company's operating divisions in order to increase organic revenue growth, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. this initiative focuses on reducing the number of the company's operating divisions and increasing the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. the company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure.
strategic sourcing - the company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on building sourcing capability in order to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. it incorporates both enterprise-level and segment-level purchasing that cross the company's many businesses.
divestiture of majority interest in former decorative surfaces segment on october 31, 2012, the company divested a 51% majority interest in the decorative surfaces segment. accordingly, the company ceased consolidating the results of the decorative surfaces segment as of october 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest using the equity method of accounting. due to the company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest, the historical operating results of decorative surfaces are presented in continuing operations. effective november 1, 2012, decorative surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the company. see the divestiture of majority interest in former decorative surfaces segment note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of this transaction.
discontinued operations the company periodically reviews its operations for businesses that may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. as a result, the company may commit to a plan to exit or dispose of certain businesses and present them as discontinued operations.
in february 2013, the company announced that it was initiating a review process to explore strategic alternatives for the industrial packaging segment. in september 2013, the company's board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging segment. the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations.
on february 6, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging business to the carlyle group for $3.2 billion. the transaction was completed on may 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in income from discontinued operations.
in the third quarter of 2013, the company also committed to plans for the divestiture of a construction distribution business previously included in the construction products segment and a specialty coatings business previously included in the polymers & fluids segment. the construction distribution and specialty coatings businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013.
in the first quarter of 2013, the company committed to plans for the divestiture of two transportation related businesses and a machine components business previously included in the specialty products segment, two construction distribution businesses previously included in the construction products segment, and a chemical manufacturing business previously included in the polymers & fluids segment. these businesses were classified as held for sale beginning in the first quarter of 2013.
the operating results of the businesses discussed above, as well as certain previously divested businesses, are reported as discontinued operations in the statement of income for all periods presented. as of the second quarter of 2014, the company has completed the divestiture of all of the businesses previously classified as discontinued operations. refer to the discontinued operations note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for discussion of the company's discontinued operations.

decorative surfaces the decorative surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. principal end markets served include commercial, renovation and residential construction.
on august 15, 2012, the company entered into a definitive agreement (the "investment agreement") to divest a 51% majority interest in its decorative surfaces segment to certain funds managed by clayton, dubilier & rice, llc ("cd&r"). under the terms of the investment agreement, the company contributed the assets and stock of the decorative surfaces segment to a newly formed entity, wilsonart international holdings llc ("wilsonart"). the transaction closed on october 31, 2012, reducing the company's ownership of wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. the company ceased consolidating the results of the decorative surfaces segment as of october 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. due to the company's continuing involvement through its 49% interest in wilsonart, the historical operating results of decorative surfaces are presented in continuing operations. additionally, effective november 1, 2012, the operating results of decorative surfaces were no longer reviewed by senior management of the company and therefore, effective the fourth quarter of 2012, decorative surfaces was no longer a reportable segment of the company. see the divestiture of majority interest in former decorative surfaces segment note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of this transaction.
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets the company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2014, 2013 and 2012. in the third quarter of 2014, these assessments resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and total indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $3 million in the polymers & fluids and test & measurement and electronics segments. in 2013, these assessments resulted in no goodwill impairment charges and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $2 million in the test & measurement and electronics segment. in 2012, these assessments resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $1 million in the test & measurement and electronics segment and an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $1 million in the food equipment segment. see the goodwill and intangible assets note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further details of the impairment charges.
interest expense interest expense increased to $250 million in 2014, which includes interest expense on the notes issued in february 2014 and the euro notes issued in may 2014, versus $239 million in 2013. interest expense increased in 2013, which included the full year impact of interest expense on the 3.9% notes issued in late august 2012, versus $213 million in 2012. see the debt note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further details regarding the company's debt obligations.
gain on sale of interest in decorative surfaces in the fourth quarter of 2012, the company recorded a pre-tax gain of $933 million ($632 million after-tax) related to the sale of a 51% majority interest in the former decorative surfaces segment. see the divestiture of majority interest in former decorative surfaces segment note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further discussion of this transaction.
other income (expense) was income of $61 million in 2014 versus $72 million in 2013. this decrease was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million recorded in 2013 related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment, partially offset by higher interest income ($65 million in 2014 versus $50 million in 2013).
other income (expense) was income of $72 million in 2013 versus $11 million in 2012. this increase was primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $30 million recorded in the first quarter of 2013 related to the acquisition of the controlling interest in an existing equity investment, higher interest income ($50 million in 2013 versus $38 million in 2012) and lower equity investment losses related to wilsonart ($14 million in 2013 versus $30 million in 2012).
see the other income (expense) note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further details.
income taxes the effective tax rate was 30.0% in 2014, 30.6% in 2013, and 30.3% in 2012. the effective tax rate for 2013 was unfavorably impacted by a $40 million discrete tax charge in the third quarter of 2013 related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. the effective tax rate for 2012 was unfavorably impacted by discrete tax charges totaling $36 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, which included $35 million for the settlement of an irs tax audit for the years 2008-2009.
see the income taxes note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for further details on these discrete tax adjustments and a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.
income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was $1.1 billion in 2014, $49 million in 2013 and $637 million in 2012. income from discontinued operations in 2014 included an after-tax gain of $1.1 billion on the disposal of the industrial packaging business in the second quarter of 2014. income from discontinued operations in 2013 included after-tax losses on disposals of $72 million and goodwill impairment of $42 million related to various divested businesses. income from discontinued operations in 2012 included an after-tax gain of $372 million related to the sale of the finishing group of businesses. see the discontinued operations note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for discussion of the company's discontinued operations.
new accounting pronouncements in april 2014, the financial accounting standards board ("fasb") issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in a company's operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations, with expanded disclosures. in addition, disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify as a discontinued operation is required. the company adopted this new guidance effective january 1, 2015. the new guidance applies prospectively to new disposals and new classifications of disposal groups held for sale after such date. as a result, this guidance did not have any impact on the company's financial statements or related disclosures upon adoption.
in may 2014, the fasb issued authoritative guidance to change the criteria for revenue recognition. the core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. in addition, several new revenue recognition disclosures will be required. this guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1, 2017. the company is currently assessing the potential impact the guidance will have upon adoption.
liquidity and capital resources the company's primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flow and short-term credit facilities. in addition, the company had $4.0 billion of cash on hand at december 31, 2014 and also maintains strong access to public debt markets. management believes that these sources are sufficient to service debt and to finance the company's capital allocation priorities, which include:
•   acquisitions.
in september 2013, the company's board of directors authorized a plan to commence a sale process for the industrial packaging business. the company classified the industrial packaging segment as held for sale beginning in the third quarter of 2013 and no longer presented this segment as part of its continuing operations. as to the impact of this divestiture on the company's income per share from continuing operations and capital structure going forward, the company also indicated that it intended to repurchase approximately 50 million shares through a program utilizing its existing share repurchase authorization to offset the full amount of divestiture-related dilution of income per share from continuing operations through a combination of sale proceeds, free operating cash flow and additional leverage. the company completed this program in the second quarter of 2014. under this program, the company repurchased approximately 14.0 million shares of its common stock in the fourth quarter of 2013 and approximately 35.7 million shares of its common stock in the first half of 2014.
on february 6, 2014, the company announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to sell the industrial packaging business to the carlyle group for $3.2 billion. the transaction was completed on may 1, 2014, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax) in the second quarter of 2014 which was included in income from discontinued operations. a portion of the proceeds was used to fund share repurchases under the program noted above.
the company believes that, based on its revenues, operating margins, current free operating cash flow, and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary.
cash flow the company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment. the company believes this non-gaap financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and measures the company's ability to generate cash internally to fund company initiatives. free operating cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities less additions to plant and equipment. free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.
net cash provided by operating activities                                                                 $1,616              $2,528              $2,072
additions to plant and equipment                                                                            (361   )            (368   )            (382   )
acquisition of businesses (excluding cash and equivalents) and additional interest in affiliates             (45   )            (369   )            (723   )
the 2014 net cash provided by operating activities included $724 million of tax payments related to the disposition of the industrial packaging segment. cash dividends paid during 2013 do not include the dividend payment of $174 million originally scheduled to be paid in january 2013, which was accelerated and paid in december 2012.
stock repurchase programs on may 6, 2011, the company's board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provided for the buyback of up to $4.0 billion of the company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2011 program"). under the 2011 program, the company repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $43.20 per share during 2011, approximately 35.5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $56.93 per share during 2012 and approximately 26.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $71.89 per share during 2013. as of december 31, 2013, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the 2011 program.
on august 2, 2013, the company's board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to an additional $6.0 billion of the company's common stock over an open-ended period of time (the "2013 program"). under the 2013 program, the company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $81.62 per share during 2013 and approximately 50.4 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $84.92 per share during 2014. as of december 31, 2014, there was approximately $1.4 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under the 2013 program.
adjusted return on average invested capital the company uses adjusted return on average invested capital ("adjusted roic") to measure the effectiveness of its operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. adjusted roic is a non-gaap financial measure that the company believes is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's financial performance and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate roic. to improve comparability of adjusted roic in the periods presented, after-tax operating income excludes the operating income of the former decorative surfaces segment. adjusted average invested capital represents the net assets of the company, excluding cash and equivalents and outstanding debt, which are excluded as they do not represent capital investment in the company's operations, as well as the company's net investment in the former decorative surfaces and industrial packaging segments, and the equity investment in the wilsonart business. average invested capital is calculated using balances at the start of the period and at the end of each quarter.
invested capital:
total invested capital                                                      $10,291             $12,435             $12,839
average invested capital                                                    $11,249             $12,605             $13,160
adjusted average invested capital                                           $10,671             $10,959             $11,382
adjusted return on average invested capital                                    18.9   %            16.3   %            14.5   %
adjusted roic increased 260 basis points in 2014 versus 2013 as a result of improvement in after-tax operating income of 13.0% and a decrease in adjusted average invested capital of 2.6%. adjusted roic increased 180 basis points in 2013 versus 2012 as a result of improvement in after-tax operating income of 8.4% and a decrease in adjusted average invested capital of 3.7%.
the 2013 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $40 million related to the tax treatment of intercompany financing transactions that impact the taxability of foreign earnings. the 2012 effective tax rate included a discrete tax charge of $36 million, which included $35 million for the settlement of an irs tax audit for the years 2008-2009.
a reconciliation of the effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate excluding the discrete tax items is as follows:
working capital management uses working capital as a measurement of the short-term liquidity of the company. net working capital at december 31, 2014 and 2013 is summarized as follows:
current liabilities:
liabilities held for sale                           -                 317                  (317        )
net working capital                            $4,543              $3,782                  $761
the increase in net working capital as of december 31, 2014 was primarily due to lower current maturities of long-term debt resulting from the repayment of $1.0 billion of 5.25% euro notes in october 2014 and $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes in april 2014, partially offset by a $1.5 billion decrease in net assets held for sale primarily related to the sale of the industrial packaging business.
cash and equivalents totaled approximately $4.0 billion as of december 31, 2014 and $3.6 billion as of december 31, 2013, primarily all of which was held by international subsidiaries and may be subject to u.s. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes if repatriated to the u.s. cash balances held internationally are typically used for international operating needs, reinvested to fund expansion of existing international businesses, used to fund new international acquisitions, or used to repay debt held internationally. in the u.s., the company utilizes cash flows from domestic operations to fund domestic cash needs which primarily consist of dividend payments, share repurchases, acquisitions, servicing of domestic debt obligations and general corporate needs. the company also uses its commercial paper program, which is backed by long-term credit facilities of $2.5 billion, for short-term liquidity needs. the company believes cash generated domestically and liquidity provided by the company's commercial paper program will continue to be sufficient to fund cash requirements in the u.s.
short-term debt as of december 31, 2014 and december 31, 2013 included commercial paper of $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. in addition, at december 31, 2013 the company classified €750 million of 5.25% euro notes due october 1, 2014 and $800 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due april 1, 2014 as short-term debt, which were repaid on the respective due dates.
the company may issue commercial paper to fund general corporate needs, share repurchases, and small and medium-sized acquisitions. the company has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the u.s. to support the potential issuances of commercial paper. of this amount, $1.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of august 15, 2018 and $1.5 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of june 8, 2017. no amounts were outstanding under these two facilities at december 31, 2014. the maximum outstanding commercial paper balance during 2014 was $2.3 billion, while the average daily balance was $858 million. as of december 31, 2014, the company's foreign operations had authorized credit facilities with unused capacity of $330 million.
total debt to ebitda the company uses the ratio of total debt to ebitda to measure its ability to repay its outstanding debt obligations. the company believes that total debt to ebitda is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating the company's long term financial liquidity and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to ebitda. ebitda and the ratio of total debt to ebitda are non-gaap financial measures. the ratio of total debt to ebitda represents total debt divided by income from continuing operations before interest expense, other income (expense), income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets on a trailing twelve month basis.
total debt to ebitda for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:
ebitda                                                                       $3,395              $3,036
total debt to ebitda ratio                                                      2.2                 2.1
stockholders' equity the changes to stockholders' equity during 2014 and 2013 were as follows:
as of december 31, 2014, the company had recorded noncurrent liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of $157 million. the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits.
the company did not have any significant off-balance sheet commitments at december 31, 2014.
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has six accounting policies that it believes are most important to the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. management bases its estimates on historical experience, and in some cases on observable market information. various assumptions are also used that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company's critical accounting policies are as follows:
realizability of inventories-inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. generally, the company's businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:
usage classification   criteria                                                                                   reserve %
active                 quantity on hand is less than prior 6 months of usage                                       0      %
slow-moving            some usage in last 12 months, but quantity on hand exceeds prior 6 months of usage         50      %
in addition, for approximately 22% of total inventories, the company has elected to use the last-in, first-out ("lifo") method of inventory costing. generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out ("fifo") method due to the effects of inflation.
collectibility of accounts receivable-the company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. in addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.
buildings and improvements   150% declining balance machinery and equipment      200% declining balance the majority of the company's international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis.
income taxes-the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. the company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the company's various tax planning strategies and uncertain tax positions. future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company.
goodwill and intangible assets-the company's business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which are a significant portion of the company's total assets and affect the amount of amortization expense and impairment charges that the company could incur in future periods. the company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the company compares the estimated fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a potential goodwill impairment exists. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. in calculating the fair value of the reporting units or specific intangible assets, management relies on a number of factors, including business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management's judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.
as of december 31, 2014, the company had total goodwill and intangible assets of $6.5 billion allocated to its reporting units. although there can be no assurance that the company will not incur additional impairment charges related to its goodwill and other intangible assets, the company generally believes the risk of significant impairment charges is lessened by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its reporting units that have goodwill and other intangible assets. in addition, the individual businesses in many of the reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and in many cases have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the company's 80/20 business process. the amount of goodwill and other intangible assets allocated to individual reporting units ranges from approximately $59 million to $1.6 billion, with the average amount equal to $461 million.
fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the company's global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.
pension and other postretirement benefits-the company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of u.s. employees and many employees outside the u.s. pension and other postretirement benefit expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participant's years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets, life expectancy, and health care cost trend rates. future changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the amounts recorded related to the company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans. see the pension and other postretirement benefits note in item 8. financial statements and supplementary data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
during 2014, the society of actuaries released a new mortality table, referred to as rp-2014, which is believed to better reflect mortality improvements. the company used the rp-2014 mortality table to measure its u.s. pension and other postretirement obligations as of december 31, 2014, resulting in an increase in pension obligations of $76 million and an increase in other postretirement obligations of $46 million as of december 31, 2014.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the year-end measurement date for the u.s. primary pension plan. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the u.s. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $37 million.
